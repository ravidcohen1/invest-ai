2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/garena-relaunches-free-fire-in-india-a-year-after-ban/,TechCrunch,Garena relaunches Free Fire in India a year after ban,"Garena is relaunching Free Fire in India, a year and a half after the popular mobile title was banned in the South Asian market over national security concerns. The firm, owned by South Asian giant Sea, said it has partnered with Yotta, controlled by local giant Hiranandani, for cloud and other storage needs of local users’ data in the country. It has also appointed Indian cricket legend Mahendra Singh Dhoni as its brand ambassador in the country. The company said it has further localized Free Fire for the Indian market — incorporating “unique content” and creating an environment that “encourage(s) a safe, healthy and fun gameplay experience” — and will make the title available in the country on September 5. Free Fire India users will be encouraged to take breaks after certain intervals, the company said. Before it was banned, Free Fire enjoyed significant popularity in India with around 40 million monthly active users. It was a close competitor to Krafton’s PUBG and BGMI, which are also immensely popular in the country. India’s ban on Free Fire immediately wiped $16 billion off Sea’s market cap last year. “We look forward to providing an engaging and highly localised experience for Indian users,” said Gang Ye, co-founder of Garena, in a statement. “We believe our partnership with Yotta will ensure that our users can enjoy the highest quality gameplay experience and benefit from Yotta’s expertise in protecting and securing Indian user data.” Data and Image Credits: HSBC. Research: Sensor Tower, HSBC Garena’s move follows Krafton securing a re-entry of BGMI in India on a trial basis. Last year, Sea also quietly attempted to launch its e-commerce platform Shopee in India but ceased the initiative weeks after the ban on Free Fire. Industry executives say that Garena still needs to change its tack in the country and should attempt to mirror Krafton strategy by investing in local firms. “We still believe that Sea needs to present a more vocal identity for its India business, and for that, it needs to hire an established CEO,” AllianceBernstein analysts wrote last year. “This is required to bring an identity to its Indian business, rather than being operated from the region.” Sea didn’t respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. India’s Ministry of Electronics and IT hasn’t commented on Free Fire’s return. “Garena’s launch of Free Fire India and commitment to localising and developing the esports ecosystem locally is testament to the vibrancy of the mobile games and esports space in India, and to India’s potential for global leadership in this area,” said H.E. Simon Wong, High Commissioner of Singapore to India, at an event Thursday. “I look forward to greater partnerships in the digital media, entertainment and esports fields between India and Singapore.”"
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/fitbit-gdpr-data-transfer-complaints-noyb/,TechCrunch,Fitbit targeted with trio of data transfer complaints in Europe,"Google-owned Fitbit is facing a trio of privacy complaints in the European Union which allege the company is illegally exporting user data in breach of the bloc’s data protection rules. The complaints target Fitbit’s claim that users have consented to international transfers of their information — to the U.S. and elsewhere — arguing the company is forcing consent from users which does not meet the required legal standard. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) lays out a set of rules for how local users’ information can be used, including requiring data processors to have a valid legal basis for processing people’s data and setting controls on data exports. Breaches of the regime can carry financial penalties as high as 4% of the infringer’s global annual turnover. The lawful basis being claimed by Fitbit to export EU users’ data — consent — needs to meet certain standards to be valid. In short, it must be informed, specific and freely given. But the complaints argue Fitbit is illegally forcing consent since users wanting to use products and services they have paid for have no choice to consent to the data exports in order for the products to work. The complaints also allege Fitbit is failing to provide adequate information to users regarding transfers of their data — meaning they also cannot provide informed consent, as the GDPR requires. They also highlight that Fitbit users are unable to withdraw consent as they should be able to under the GDPR — short of deleting their Fitbit accounts and losing all their tracked workouts. Which means Fitbit users face having their product experience penalized for revoking consent.  European privacy rights not-for-profit, noyb, has filed the complaints with data protection authorities in Austria, the Netherlands and Italy on behalf of three (unnamed) Fitbit users. Commenting in a statement, Maartje de Graaf, data protection lawyer at noyb, said: “First, you buy a Fitbit watch for at least €100. Then you sign up for a paid subscription, only to find that you are forced to ‘freely’ agree to the sharing of your data with recipients around the world. Five years into the GDPR, Fitbit is still trying to enforce a ‘take it or leave it’ approach.” noyb has been behind scores of successful GDPR complaints in recent years — including a series of strikes against Meta (Facebook) which recently led to the company announcing it will finally switch to asking local users’ consent for the tracking and profiling that powers its core behavioral ad targeting. So noyb’s strategic litigations are always worth watching. “When creating an account with Fitbit, European users are obliged to ‘agree to the transfer of their data to the United States and other countries with different data protection laws’. This means, that their data could end up in any country around the globe that does not have the same privacy protections as the EU,” noyb writes in a press release announcing the Fitbit complaints. “In other words: Fitbit forces its users to consent to sharing sensitive data without providing them with clear information about possible implications or the specific countries their data goes to. This results in a consent that is neither free, informed or specific — which means that the consent clearly doesn’t meet the GDPR’s requirements.” “According to Fitbit’s privacy policy, the shared data not only includes things like a user’s email address, date of birth and gender. The company can also share ‘data like logs for food, weight, sleep, water, or female health tracking; an alarm; and messages on discussion boards or to your friends on the Services’. The collected data can even be shared for processing with third-party companies of which we do not know where they are located,” it goes on. “Furthermore, it is impossible for users to find out which specific data even is affected. All three complainants exercised their right of access to information with the company’s Data Protection Officer — but never received an answer.” The complaints also question the validity of Fitbit relying on consent for what are routine transfers of sensitive data outside the bloc. “The GDPR clearly states that consent can only be used as an exception to the prohibition of data transfers outside the EU — which means that consent can only be a valid legal basis for occasional and non-repetitive data transfers. Fitbit, however, is using consent to share all health data routinely,” noyb suggests, arguing Fitbit’s transfers are “clearly systematic” and also questioning whether they can “pass the strict necessity test”, given how much personal data (including some sensitive data) is being routinely exported. While the EU’s executive body, the European Commission, adopted a new adequacy data transfer agreement with U.S. counterparts last month — a high level deal which aims to shrink the legal risks around transatlantic data flows — noyb notes that Fitbit is not claiming to rely on this so-called EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework for EU users’ data exports. “Fitbit doesn’t state in its privacy policy or elsewhere that it transfers data under the new framework but instead it states that it uses consent and SCCs [standard contractual clauses] as ‘transfer mechanisms’,” de Graaf told TechCrunch. “Fitbit also isn’t certified under the data privacy framework. “Apart from that, it is only a matter of time until noyb will be challenging the validity of the new framework before the CJEU [Court of Justice of the EU]. The fundamental problems with U.S. surveillance laws still exist.” noyb confirmed it expects the three complaints to be funnelled back to Google’s lead data protection watchdog in the EU, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), in line with the GDPR’s one-stop-shop mechanism for streamlining cross-border complaints. Early in 2019 Google switched the legal jurisdiction of where it processes European users’ data, from the U.S. to its Dublin-based entity, Google Ireland Limited — which led to its European HQ gaining what’s known as main establishment status under the GDPR, meaning lead oversight of Google’s compliance with the EU’s flagship data protection regime falls to the Irish DPC. (Prior to that Google was hit with an early GDPR enforcement in France related to elements of how it operated its Android smartphone OS.) The Irish regulator continues to be criticized over the plodding pace, tortuously winding pathways or just total lack of enforcement atop tech giants. This includes in the case of a number of major GDPR complaints targeting Google — such as one focused on Google’s location tracking (which the DPC opened in February 2020); and another into Google’s adtech (which the Irish regulator kicked off in May 2019). Neither of those probes into aspects of Google’s business have yielded a decision out of Ireland yet. And in the case of the latter enquiry, the DPC was actually sued by the complainants last year which accuse the regulator of failing to investigate the substance of the complaint. In the case of noyb’s recent major strikes on Meta/Facebook, the DPC has also been accused of impeding enforcement by siding with Meta’s arguments on legal basis — a finding that was overturned by other EU DPAs and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) via a process of objection and review baked into the GDPR. So, given the DPC’s record on oversight of big tech, a swift outcome to this trio of Fitbit complaints seems unlikely — even as enforcement of the GDPR more generally has been gathering some momentum, thanks to a growing body of clarifying CJEU rulings in the five+ years since it came into application. If noyb’s complaints against Fitbit trigger an investigation by the DPC — and GDPR infringements are confirmed down the line — Google could face fines in the billions of dollars given its parent company, Alphabet, saw its annual revenue reach $283 billion last year. (noyb suggests it could be on the hook for fines of up to €11.28 billion if the breaches are confirmed.) Although, again, the DPC has not only avoided levying the maximum possible penalties on major big tech GDPR breaches its draft decisions have frequently penciled in lower penalties than other EU DPAs (and the EDPB) view as appropriate — leading to interventions under the regulation’s dispute settlement mechanisms which have often raised the levels of penalties finally applied in Ireland, even as these push-backs have typically added many extra months to enforcement timelines. So expect any enforcement on these complaints to be a marathon, not a sprint."
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/teale-your-mental-health-companion-at-work-raises-11-million/,TechCrunch,"Teale, your mental health companion at work, raises $11 million","French startup Teale has secured a funding round of $11 million earlier this summer (€10 million). The company provides a mental health platform for employees and helps HR managers when it comes to preventing burnout or quiet quitting. Alter Equity and Bpifrance’s Digital Venture fund are leading the Series A funding round. Existing investors Isai and Evolem are also investing once again in the startup. Teale is a double-faceted platform. It can be seen as a perk for employees as many people believe their employers should provide some form of support when it comes to mental health. But it’s also been designed so that HR managers can see when there’s something wrong in the organization. “Our mission is really to ask ourselves what we can do to democratize mental health, destigmatize this topic and really put technology, data and science at the service of mental health, obviously to help employees, but also to build healthier organizations,” Teale co-founder and CEO Julia Néel Biz told me. When your company sends you an email and tells you that you can use Teale for free, it means that any employee can download and install the app and start using it to better understand their mental health. And it starts with a survey that will be used to rate your mental health based on multiple criteria. “It’s a proprietary index we created with our scientific advisory board and the psychologists who partner with our team. Our scientific advisory board is made up of psychiatrists and doctors of psychology. This index has been scientifically proven to be a good measure of mental health,” Néel Biz said. After that, Teale will recommend content that could be relevant to your current situation. Teale has put together a large content library with 1,000 pieces of audio and video content on stress, sleep, burnout, bereavement, infertility, etc. And if that’s not enough, you can also book an appointment with a psychiatrist or a doctor of psychology. That’s an important feature as it can help you get started with a therapy when you don’t really know where to start. Image Credits: Teale On the management side, Teale can also be used to make sure that your company fosters a healthy work environment. Of course, Teale doesn’t want to act as a snitch that hands over a list of employees who aren’t doing well. Instead, the startup wants to give a broad overview of the current situation. At any point in time, the HR team can see if Teale is actively used in the company — how many people created an account, how many people requested an individual session, etc. And if there are more than 20 people in any business unit, department or country, Teale can indicate the average mental health score of this specific group. Some questions revolve around work load, management, the ability to disconnect, etc. Teale could be used to identify if a team is short-staffed or if there’s something wrong with a manager. So far, around 100 companies have subscribed to Teale to grant access to the service to their own employees. Some clients include some big companies, such as Sanofi, SNCF, Cartier and EY. On average, 45% of the workforce use Teale. With today’s funding round, the company will expand its team from 25 employees to 80 employees over the next 18 months. Teale also plans to expand to new countries. Image Credits: Teale"
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/feds-investigate-teslas-use-of-funds-for-secret-glass-house-project-elon-musk/,TechCrunch,Feds investigate Tesla’s use of funds for secret ‘glass house’ project,"Manhattan federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission are separately investigating the use of Tesla funds to bankroll a secret project that is described internally as a glass house for CEO Elon Musk, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal that cites people familiar with the matter. WSJ reported in July that Tesla board members were investigating potential misuse of company resources on the project, known as “Project 42,” and whether Musk was personally involved. According to the newspaper, Project 42 involves a large glass structure to be built in Austin, Texas. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has reportedly sought information about what benefits have been paid to Musk, how much Tesla spent on the project, and what the project was for, WSJ’s sources said. The SEC, which sources say is seeking similar information, has opened a civil investigation into Project 42. TechCrunch could not confirm the investigations with the SDNY or the SEC, and Tesla could not be reached for comment. The SEC requires public companies to disclose transactions above $120,000 in which a related party has a material interest. The agency also requires any perks worth more than $10,000 paid to senior executive officers be disclosed to investors. The cost of Project 42 could not be learned, but the glass building was to be built near Tesla’s Austin headquarters. Musk and Tesla have invested heavily in Texas in recent years. Aside from personally moving to the state, Musk announced his decision to relocate Tesla headquarters from Palo Alto, California to Austin in October 2021 after a series of clashes with California’s “overregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation.” Texas doesn’t tax individual income or capital gains, a true draw for the world’s richest person. Tesla also celebrated the opening of its Austin gigafactory in April 2022 with a so-called “Cyber Rodeo.” Earlier this year, Tesla said it had more than tripled its gigafactory workforce in Austin. Tesla is facing separate investigations from the Department of Justice and the SEC into the automaker’s bold claims regarding the capabilities of Autopilot, Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system. The EV maker has a fraught history with the SEC. The agency opened an investigation into Tesla after Musk tweeted in 2018 that he had  “funding secured” to take Tesla private (he didn’t), allegedly causing volatility in the share price. As part of a settlement with the SEC, Tesla and Musk both paid separate $20 million penalties, and Musk agreed to have a lawyer review his tweets. Musk has been trying to throw out the stipulation ever since, which he has referred to as a “muzzle” on his right to free speech. In August, the SEC said investors who suffered financial losses as a result of the tweet might soon receive a payout from a $42.3 million fund established as part of the securities fraud settlement."
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/googles-ai-powered-search-expands-outside-u-s-to-india-and-japan/,TechCrunch,Google’s AI-powered search expands outside US to India and Japan,"Google is bringing its generative AI search experience to the first countries outside the U.S., the company announced today, starting with expansions in India and Japan. The new AI-powered search feature, also known as SGE (Search Generative Experience), will become available through Google’s Search Labs in those markets, and will introduce a new feature aimed at making it easier to find information in its AI-powered overviews. First announced at this year’s Google I/O Developer conference in May, SGE introduces a conversational mode to Google Search where you can ask Google questions about a topic and then have it return answers, similar to an AI chatbot. The company in recent months has updated the experience with support for videos and images, local info and travel recommendations, as well as new tools to provide summaries, definitions, and more help with coding-related queries. It also began to experiment with ads that would be integrated alongside its AI-generated responses, looking to capitalize on the new real estate dedicated to the AI chat experience. With the global expansion, SGE is being customized for the newly supported regions. In Japan, users will be able to use generative AI in their local language, while in India it will support both English and Hindi with a language toggle so users can move back and forth between the two. It’s also adding voice input — something that’s popular in India — so users can speak queries instead of typing them and then listen to the responses. And in both countries, search ads will continue to appear in dedicated ad slots across the page. Alongside these launches, SGE is introducing a new feature that’s designed to make it easier for people to discover and visit the web pages that back up the information that’s offered in the AI’s responses. Image Credits: Google Starting today, users will see a new arrow icon next to information in an AI-powered overview that they can click to see the relevant web pages. This lets them visit the source of the AI’s information directly where they can learn more about the answer to their questions. This is rolling out first in the U.S., and will arrive in India and Japan in the weeks that follow. The company noted that since the launch of SGE, it’s found the feature is more popular among younger users. Google said the highest satisfaction scores are among those ages 18-24, who like to ask their questions in a more conversational manner. Google also said people liked to be able to ask follow-up questions and say they’re now asking longer and more conversational questions in full sentences. That’s a different experience than traditional Google searches where users simply type in a few keywords to start a query. It additionally claimed people were finding the integrated ads useful, but didn’t provide data on click-through rates. To access SGE, you can find it in the Search Labs section of the Google app on Android and iOS and on Chrome on the desktop."
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/techcrunch-interview-palo-alto-author-malcolm-harris/,TechCrunch,TechCrunch interview: ‘Palo Alto’ author Malcolm Harris,"Most of the tenets that helped capitalism take root and thrive in California two centuries ago are still in place today. The Golden State didn’t invent venture capital, incubators for young talent or higher education partnerships, but just like chardonnay and cannabis, these are concepts we improved upon and commodified for export. It’d be simplistic to describe author and critic Malcolm Harris as a contrarian. In previous books, he punched holes in the stereotype that millennials are coddled crybabies (“Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials”) and demanded that we reexamine our assumptions about American exceptionalism (“Shit Is Fucked Up and Bullshit: History Since the End of History”). In his latest book, “Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism, and the World,” Harris spends 628 pages presenting what he describes as “the standard materialist understanding of Northern California history,” which begins with genocide against indigenous people. In the final pages, we learn that some of the ancient burial grounds of the Muwekma Ohlone are today adjacent to “one of the highest concentrations of capital of any kind in world history.” I spoke to Harris last week and opened the interview with a confession: I didn’t finish his book in time for our chat. “Best of luck,” he replied. “I don’t take it personally. It’s a long book.” This interview has been edited for space and clarity. TC: Was there an inciting incident that made you want to write this expansive “history of California, capitalism and the world”? Or has this been brewing for a long time? MH: For writers in my cohort, there’s a trade-off: You can write about the worst thing that ever happened in the place where you grew up, interweave it with history, and maybe that’s your best shot at a good book. That’s sort of originally how I sold it, and luckily — for everyone, myself included — that’s not the book I ended up writing. You grew up in Santa Cruz, but you attended Palo Alto High School. I was born in Santa Cruz. But I grew up from 8-18 in Palo Alto. That’s a crunchy college town on the coast, but it’s also a bit of a bedroom community for some people in Silicon Valley. What was your sense of the tech industry growing up there in the ’90s?  We were still in the PC boom, so there were people around town who had a lot of money and it was never clear where that money came from. It had something to do with the tech industry, like, “Fred’s dad invented the case on the Palm Pilot, so they have a big house.” That’s what the tech industry was to me, more or less. And my dad sort of worked adjacent to it as an IP lawyer. He’d grown up with computers and been a hacker in the ’80s and ended up doing computer law. He was part of that world, but I didn’t connect the two even though most of his practice was tech stuff. So I didn’t really have a strong grasp of it. Even when I was in high school, and Facebook was starting, it wasn’t central to me. I was really interested in politics, and tech didn’t seem very aligned. I didn’t see the relationship between them, which reflected my child’s view of the world at the time. Culturally, when did tech start sucking up so much oxygen? I feel like some of it’s been since I wrote this book, even just since 2020. Not just culturally, but economically, it’s sucked up so much more oxygen, as you say. It’s hard to think back even just a few years ago when tech people were not on the front page of every newspaper every day in America, but also, a lot of it happened after I left town. I graduated high school in 2007. Facebook was just starting the social media boom, but that hadn’t really exploded yet, so it wasn’t an aspirational lifestyle for young people. When I started reading your book, I thought of Herbert Hoover as the one-term president who ushered in the Great Depression. As it turns out, he was one of the most influential Americans of the 20th century. How would you describe his legacy? He’s more pivotal as far as shaping the way we live today than FDR in many ways. In this conflict between those two men, we’re taught that FDR beats Hoover and that FDR shapes the 20th century of America. I don’t think that ends up being true. Hoover outlives him, not just chronologically, but politically — he dies in 1964. At that point, you’ve got multiple presidents who have asked Hoover back into the government. I did not set out to write dozens of pages about Herbert Hoover, I knew he was an important son of Palo Alto. But I didn’t know he was one of the most important people of the 20th century. Not just in America, but in the world. You wrote, “Capital by its nature dominates labor. And if it fails to accomplish that, it ceases to exist.” You talk a lot about organized labor in the book. It’s an essential aspect of California’s agricultural and industrial economy. But the tech workforce is not unionized in any meaningful sense. Why do you think that is? [Labor] organizers have found tech to be a hard place to organize. One story that really illustrates that is Xerox’s investment in Apple Computer.

			Elon Musk, I haven’t even researched that much, because I don’t even think he’s that interesting.							Malcolm Harris


 The famous story is that Xerox PARC researchers showed their whole setup to Apple’s tech people, who took it and ran, and Xerox wasn’t there with them and sort of missed the opportunity. My revisionist history is that the reason Xerox was doing that technology exchange in the first place is because they had invested $100,000 for a stake of Apple. Not because Apple had the best technologists . . . [but] because Apple was the best manufacturer. And the reason why Apple was the best manufacturer wasn’t because it was like they had figured out some superior process; it’s because they figured out a new labor bargain, which is that they had immigrant housewives in kitchens throughout the Bay Area assembling their boards. And Xerox was looking to them as a potential contract manufacturer for Xerox’s personal computer, and that’s why they wanted to invest in Apple. What those firms really offered was not a technological or manufacturing edge. What they were flexible on was what they were paying the manufacturing workers. And that allowed production to shift toward these firms and toward the west, which is not unionized and not organized. Offshoring starts in the chip industry in 1961. So that history is real deep. To work in a startup, you have to distort reality to believe that success is not just possible, but also likely. I think it makes the idea of joining a union counterintuitive, like, “Why do I need union protection when I’m on track to becoming a millionaire?” You start thinking that you are a capitalist, because in some of those industries, the pay in terms of stock options is such a high percentage of that potential compensation, even if it might be a long shot. But the history of that is that same history, which is when HP introduced employee stock options in the first place. It wasn’t really because they wanted employee buy-in. And it definitely wasn’t because they were a startup and they couldn’t afford people. For them, it was a good way to get nondiluting capital into the business. Because you’re recovering your own labor costs and getting your workers to loan their pay back to you when they’re exercising options or buying options. I have no problem asking investors to help solve business-related problems, but it seems like a lot of prominent ones are autodidact polymaths on everything from public health to tank warfare in Ukraine. Did successful businesspeople always present themselves as domain experts, or is this a more recent phenomenon driven by social media? No, no, it’s definitely a long-running phenomenon. Leland Stanford is a great example: a real goofy guy, who in addition to being a sort of frontman for this capitalist syndicate that was ripping off the government, was also the governor of the state. In addition to considering himself an expert in horses, an expert in social arrangement, an expert in immigration, he was a self-declared expert in many, many things and had the capital to sort of prove it or demonstrate it in some of them. So he’s a great analog for people of today. Herbert Hoover’s another one. He goes from being a mining engineer to being a political leader pretty directly through being a self-promotional rich guy. David Packard was a deputy secretary of defense under Nixon. In military-industrial terms, you could argue that someone like Musk is playing a bigger role than that today. There’s little scientific rigor backing up the current cohort of great men. It’s just wealth. You saw a transition during the PC era, where you had Steve Jobs and the rise of suburban boy wonders who no longer had to be selected by the military or higher education. In the case of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, both of them dropped out of college. Bill Gates gets to spend more time on mainframe computers than almost any other kid in the country, and it’s because he goes to this private school that has access to computers. He trains himself pretty well and does a good job. You have this sort of “Revenge of the Nerds” moment in the ’80s and ’90s, where they say, “We’re smart we don’t need the university’s approval, we don’t need anyone’s approval. I can wear a T-shirt and drip Hot Pockets on it. I don’t need to wear a suit and have gone to Columbia for my PhD in chemistry.” I still see a lot of investors and founders performing this behavior. The more you can display this sort of anti-systemic verve, the smarter you seem to look, except now we see the sort of degeneration where you no longer have to even have the self-trained technical expertise. Elon Musk, I haven’t even researched that much, because I don’t even think he’s that interesting. But Sam Altman dropped out of Stanford when he was a sophomore because he thought that dropping out of Stanford as a sophomore sounded good for his first tech company. No one says that this guy is a top-level programmer who has invented anything except for a Foursquare competitor that got squashed. Otherwise, he’s been doling out other people’s money and some money that they let him use for a while despite him not doing anything successfully. But now he is one of those guys, right? He’s one of the top 20 tech oligarchs at this point in history, which is ridiculous. Whenever his face appears in anything, he’s got this look of a guy who told the king he’s going to turn the straw into gold by tomorrow. He doesn’t know how he’s gonna do it. He’s sitting at home hitting the Rumpelstiltskin button trying to figure out how he’s gonna get Microsoft their money back. To me, the reason why Elon Musk is not interesting is because he’s so fantastically wealthy. There’s no drama because there’s no chance of failure, which Silicon Valley defines as running out of money.  The characteristic that they’re looking for is that willingness and eagerness to take risks, because that’s what the economy needs. The economy doesn’t need sound investment that’s going to return 5% or whatever. If they wanted to do that, they could build solar panels, right? We need something that offers real growth potential for this money, that can absorb hundreds of billions of dollars. The real challenge is coming up with some kind of story that can absorb that much capital. Because they don’t have anywhere to put it. They’ve got to offer something that’s going to offer unbelievable returns. And who can do that? A con man, you know, that’s who can do that. And we saw that definitely with crypto and NFTs, which was sort of that to the nth degree. We saw that with the metaverse, which is the same thing: a whole industry just based on the idea of hyping things. I think it’s more or less the same thing with what I hesitate to call “AI” or generative software that I think ultimately people are going to realize doesn’t do anything, doesn’t make anything. And it’s possible that its uses are actually way, way, way more constrained than people are imagining. That sounds like every hype cycle I’ve ever lived through. It’s been pretty amazing that since this book has come out, we’ve gone through like three of these: the speed is clearly increasing. When I published, the first thing people said was, “Oh, don’t you wish you wrote about cryptocurrency?” And I was like, “No, I don’t think it’s gonna last — I don’t think that’s going to keep my book on the shelf.” Now people don’t even remember to ask that. You wrote, “It’s often said that under capitalism, relations between people appear as relations between things.” With that as subtext, what do you make of the on-again, off-again cage match between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg? Yeah, it’s pretty funny to see these guys who stand for these companies try to fight each other in a literal sense. I think Elon Musk talks a lot of shit and that’s part of the story, right? I do think it’s interesting how tech guys have gotten interested in this Ultimate Fighting stuff. Hyper-masculinity, I would even say. It’s part of their interest in fitness and eugenics. Fitness, with a capital F, not like feeling well, but evolutionary fitness and proving not just that they are smart, but that they are superior individuals. And that goes way back to the beginning of Stanford and David Starr Jordan, its first president, saying, “We need to substitute football for war, because we don’t want them to actually die. But we still need to see who the best ones are.” I saw an episode of the show “Friends” where Jon Favreau is playing a tech millionaire who decides that he is going to become the ultimate fighting champion. He gets his ass totally beat. But at the same time, it gets into that psychology perfectly where he’s like, “I’ve dominated business. Now I want to dominate the combat realm!” It’s still very much a joke, but now it’s actually happening in real life. Black founders received 1% of all venture capital last year and women-founded startups raised 1.9% of the total. We’ve been bemoaning the lack of representation in tech for decades: Can this system be reformed? I don’t think so. Even if you were able to reform the personnel, they’d still be running the same system, and it’s a system that’s based on increasing labor exploitation. We know that all people have an equally distributed chance of aptitude for everything because humans are one species. Which means there’s like a big growth opportunity there for investing in women-led startups in theory, right? You look at that number, and you say, “Their irrational sexism is causing them not to invest in these firms; I should invest in them. Let me fix this in terms of market efficiency.” People have been making that argument for a long time now. And to see that it hasn’t happened, I think suggests that story isn’t true and that there is something about capitalism that is based on this kind of cartel action that is about intentionally limiting the range of opportunities that are allowed to people [who are] outside certain circles. The racial and sexual division of labor in tech is foundational to its existence. And I don’t think a personnel change is going to fix that. Unlike 19th-century industrialists, tech entrepreneurs don’t seem as interested in building parks or libraries or hospitals. Am I being ungenerous? I don’t sense that there’s a philanthropic drive underpinning what they’re doing. I think they would say that there is. Zuckerberg can say, “Well, I got a hospital. What about my hospital?” I live in San Francisco. Everyone still calls it “General,” and no one calls it “Zuckerberg.” As they should. I think they would say that they are more efficient. We can see that in the effective altruism movement, where they say, “I don’t want to just give money or books to the people. I want to solve problems. And the way I solve problems is I fund my foundation. And my foundation does quantitative analysis of what things will really solve problems, and I’m gonna put my money into those things, it’ll solve problems, and you’ll never hear about it. I’m making a better world and you don’t know about it. In fact, you’re too stupid to understand.” That’s how they’re running their philanthropy now, because that’s how they think about the world. They could give a damn about people’s access to books. If they really cared about something like that, they would have supported the Internet Archive in their legal battle, and we would have a lot more access to books now than we do, which is very unfortunate. From my perspective as sort of justifying their own existence through philanthropy, they’ve been lying down on the job. But from their perspective, they’re more philanthropic than ever; they’re just doing it efficiently. And I think that is another demonstration of how they look at the rest of us. A hundred years from now, how do you think these men will be remembered or spoken about? Oh, that’s a good question. I hope not too much. I feel like if we know Elon Musk’s name in a hundred years, that’s a very, very bad sign. I hope we’ll be able to talk about them as an impersonal mass in the way that they talk about workers now and we won’t feel the need to even think of them as individual characters, because we can understand them as a malignant social force that used to exist. We’ll be better off for it. And certainly their names won’t be on any buildings, I hope."
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/generative-ai-startup-ai21-labs-lands-155m-at-a-1-4b-valuation/,TechCrunch,Generative AI startup AI21 Labs lands $155M at a $1.4B valuation,"AI21 Labs, a Tel Aviv-based startup developing a range of text-generating AI tools, has raised $155 million in a Series C funding round led by Walden Catalyst, Pitango, SCB10X, b2venture, Samsung Next and Amnon Shashua, the founder of Intel-owned Mobileye and an AI21 Labs co-founder. Google and Nvidia also participated. The tranche, which brings AI21 Labs’ total raised to $283 million, values the company at $1.4 billion — a bit higher than the figure The Information reported earlier today ($1.2 billion). “AI21 Labs came out of stealth in October 2020 with our first launch of [AI writing tool] Wordtune,” Yoav Shoham, one of AI21 Labs’ co-CEOs, told TechCrunch via email. “Since then, we’ve only managed to grow, more than doubling our workforce with plans to add even more employees.” AI21 Labs was founded in 2017 by Shashua, Shoham and Ori Goshen, the startup’s other co-CEO. Shoham, a professor emeritus at Stanford, previously sold two companies to Google, the time management app Timeful and social network friends organizer Katango. Goshen is also a serial entrepreneur, having co-founded and led several Israel-based tech companies, including the telco analytics firm Crowdx. AI21 Labs’ flagship product is AI21 Studio, a pay-as-you-go developer platform for building custom text-based business apps off of AI21’s proprietary text-generating AI models — including its cutting-edge Jurassic-2 model. The startup also sells access to the aforementioned Wordtune, a multilingual reading and writing AI assistant akin to Grammarly. Customers can tap AI21 Labs’ platform via APIs for specific generative AI use cases, like summarization, paraphrasing and grammar and spelling correction. The startup’s models support a growing number of languages, including Spanish, German, Italian and Dutch. AI21 Labs competes with an expanding roster of startups and incumbents in the red-hot generative AI space. Google, AWS and Microsoft offer tooling comparable to AI21 Studio, as do startups like Cohere, OpenAI and Anthropic (and to a lesser extent marketing-focused vendors such as Jasper, Regie and Typeface). And AI21 Labs is at a funding disadvantage; OpenAI has raised $11.3 billion to date, while Anthropic and Cohere have raked in $1.6 billion and $435 million, respectively. But Shoham asserts that AI21 Labs’ solutions are superior in several aspects, despite looking similar on the surface and not having the benefit of a higher R&D budget. For one, Shoham says, they’re developed on “some of the world’s largest and most sophisticated large language models” and offer “more refined control” than many generative AI apps on the market. Moreover, they’re trained on up-to-date data, unlike text-generating models trained on older data, which can’t accurately answer questions about current events. AI21 Labs offers a range of tuning parameters to customize the output of its language models, which range from small, fast models to larger and more sophisticated offerings. Image Credits: AI21 Labs “The AI21’s AI systems are easy to integrate and generate reliable, trustworthy and accurate results,” Shoham said. “The quality and quantity of training data is a huge challenge in the industry. We’ve worked hard to ensure that we’re using up-to-date data, constantly training our models on additional data and working to ensure that the data used is reliable and trustworthy.” Having not tested AI21 Labs’ products recently, I can’t speak to the veracity of those claims. But exaggerated or no, AI21 Labs appears to be gaining some traction despite its disadvantages. Shoham — who wouldn’t reveal the size of AI21 Labs’ customer base, save that it includes “several” Fortune 100 companies — says that Wordtune alone has over 10 million users. And AI21 Labs was a launch partner for Bedrock, Amazon’s generative AI app development platform. Shoham says that the latest funding tranche will allow AI21 Labs to accelerate its R&D efforts and “reach its goal of developing the next level of AI,” with “the capabilities of reasoning across many domains.” AI21 Labs also plans to pursue more partnerships with companies “across the entire tech ecosystem” and increase its 200-person headcount, with a principal focus on roles in research and business development. AI21 Labs continues to build out its C-Suite, as well, recently hiring Pankaj Dugar, a former Google and Databricks exec, as its SVP of go-to-market and GM of North America. It’ll certainly need the money, given the capital-intensive nature of developing large language models. According to The Information, OpenAI spent $540 million last year creating ChatGPT. And AI21 Labs’ own research pegs the expenses for training a text-generating model with 1.5 billion parameters (i.e. variables that the model uses to generate and analyze text) at as much as $1.6 million. For reference, the predecessor to AI21 Labs’ Jurassic-2 model, Jurassic-1, contained 178 billion parameters. That’s not accounting for hosting costs to serve the models. OpenAI was at one point reportedly paying up to $700,000 a day to keep the infrastructure hosting ChatGPT up and running. Back-of-the-napkin math pegs the cost of running a model the size of GPT-3, and older OpenAI-developed model, at $87,000 per year on a service like AWS. AWS counts AI21 Labs as a partner, so it’s not clear if there’s some sort of volume discounting in play. But I’d wager to say that it’s not insignificant overhead. “We’ve focused on growing responsibly, allowing us to continue to grow and expand, bringing our customers the most up-to-date, trustworthy AI possible,” Shoham said."
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/pitch-deck-slide-suggestions/,TechCrunch,That 30-slide deck won’t cut it anymore,"There’s been a distinct trend in pitch decks recently, and I should know as I review tons of them for TechCrunch+. Pitch decks include fewer slides with less information, but getting across the right message is the name of the game. Reading between the lines of DocSend’s most recent report about VC activity in 2023, it becomes clear that getting to the point — and staying on message — is the way to catch an investor’s attention. “Pre-seed founders have responded to the investor pullback by creating shorter decks. They are rearranging the opening slides in ways I hadn’t seen before,” Justin Izzo, research lead at DocSend, told TechCrunch+. Founders are ditching the narratives around purpose, problem and solutions. “Instead, they are heading right into the ‘why now,’ here’s our product, and here’s how we’re going to monetize that product. It makes for very abrupt reading — I’m used to a little bit more narrativization — but pre-seed founders these days know that investors aren’t spending much time on the decks.” Founders are actually sending 16% more decks than they did this time last year, which means VCs have a lot to read through. Investors want to get the info they need to make an early decision on whether to spend more time with a company. From 2022 to 2023, VCs spent almost 20% less time (2 minutes 12 seconds now, compared to 2 minutes 42 seconds a year ago) reviewing pitch decks. If you’ve got 2 minutes of their time, make it count. How much does this matter? Data from DocSend indicates that 40% of successful pre-seed teams had shorter-than-average decks; 65% of unsuccessful teams had decks with more slides than average. Founders have to be ruthless, both with the number of slides in a deck and the number of words on each slide. From 2022, the average slide deck took a nosedive from 19 slides to 16. That means you have to be very intentional about what to include: Introduction: Present your company’s name, logo and a captivating tagline or image that gives an immediate sense of what your startup does. It also helps to hint at the size of the round you are hoping to raise. Mission: I like to start pitches with a mission slide or a summary slide that pulls people in. Good storytelling is layered: Give the 60,000-foot view first; then point your searchlight at different aspects of the business that help getting deeper understanding as you go along.  "
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/substack-introduces-new-ai-powered-audio-transcription-tools/,TechCrunch,Substack introduces new AI-powered audio transcription tools,"Substack is introducing new AI-powered tools that are designed to make podcasting on the platform easier, the company announced on Wednesday. With these new tools, users can easily generate transcripts and audiograms. Users can now use an AI tool to create a transcript of their podcast episode or narration in about a minute. Once you have created the transcript, you can go in and edit it to make it just how you like it. You can then publish it in its own tab on the episode post page. Then, you can select a passage that you can then use to generate a special audiogram that you can share to social media. An audiogram is like a little static video with text and the audio playing over top that you can share online. It’s essentially a neat way to show off your podcast episode. “We’ve done this all using cutting-edge AI tools, and it reflects our philosophy of not thinking that this AI stuff is ever going to take the place of work done by writers and creators—but instead we think it can give writers and creators super-powers,” the company wrote in a blog post. To access the new tools, users need to go to their dashboard and create an episode post. Once you’re in editing mode and upload your audio, you will be presented with an option to generate the transcript. You can then click the “Generate Transcript” button and wait around a minute. When you publish it, there’s a default-on toggle that will make sure that the transcript will show up in the post alongside your episode. You can choose to turn this option off if you want to. Once the transcript is published, you can select a passage and then click “Make audiogram” to generate the social sharing asset. “All of these tools are in their very early stages and they’re only going to get better and better,” Substack notes. “Stick with us for a while, because while they may not be perfect at first glance, they are going to rapidly evolve. We want you to have fun with them though, so we want to get this out to you sooner rather than later.”"
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/screenly-makes-it-easier-to-build-interactive-apps-for-its-digital-signage-platform/,TechCrunch,Screenly makes it easier to build interactive apps for its digital signage platform,"Screenly has long offered developers ways to build applications for the kiosks and checkout systems that use its Screenly Box hardware (or a Raspberry Pi, for the DIY crowd). Its customers include the likes of Amazon, NASA and Lowe’s. Today, it’s taking a next step in making it easier for developers to build applications for its platform with the launch of Edge Apps. These new Edge Apps can run right on the device, so unlike devices that rely on content served from the web, they will even run when the internet is down. And because they run locally, load times and latency are also reduced. “At Screenly, we’ve managed screens at scale for over a decade. We have solved all these complexities,” Screenly CEO Viktor Petersson said. “With Edge Apps, we enable developers to concentrate on crafting their applications using well-established web tools. We manage the intricacies, from device management to security patches, aiding businesses in reducing expenditures and expediting their time to market.” Petersson noted that a lot of the company’s customers wanted a better way to build more complex and resilient applications — as well as the ability to work with local hardware, including sensors and printers. The promise of Screenly and its new Edge Apps platform is that developers will be able to focus on the application, while Screenly handles app distribution, device management, the operating system and security functions. “Over the last decade, we’ve built what is arguably the most secure digital signage platform in the industry,” Petersson said. “It has always been severely over-engineered for just showing images, videos and web pages. Which is why we are able to enter the next phase of Screenly: opening up our screen platform to developers.” To write these Edge Apps, developers can reuse their existing web development skills. Petersson also noted that it helps to be familiar with serverless tools like Cloudflare Workers and AWS Lambda to provision their applications, since it’s using very similar concepts. To help developers get started, the company created a number of demo apps that showcase the platform’s capabilities. “Our platform offers an easier learning experience than many others,” Petersson said. “It’s designed to be both user-friendly for beginners and as dependable as a traditional desktop app.” "

Dear Sophie, Back in 2018, the Cato Institute estimated it would take 151 years for a person born in India to get a green card in the EB-2 category.  How has that changed in the wake of the pandemic, the Great Resignation, and the tech layoffs? How has the EB-1 category changed? — Living in Limbo Dear Living, Thanks for reaching out to me! I remember the Cato Institute report and have long wondered the same thing. As you pointed out, a lot has happened since that report was issued in 2018. 😁 Before we dive into the wait times for the EB-2 and EB-1 green card categories, let’s go through a refresher applicable to everybody on how employment-based green cards are allocated. At least 140,000 employment-based green cards are available at the start of each fiscal year, which begins on October 1. If any family-based green card numbers from the previous fiscal year were unused, they are added to the employment-based green card total. Each employment-based green card category is allotted a minimum of the total annual cap: The EB-1 (first preference for priority workers), EB-2 (second preference for an advanced degree or exceptional ability) and EB-3 (third preference for skilled workers) categories are allotted a minimum of 28.6% of the total annual cap. The EB-4 (special immigrants) and EB-5 (investor immigrants) categories have a minimum of 7.1% of the annual cap. Each employment-based green card category also has a per-country cap of 7%. This cap is based on an individual’s country of birth (not country of citizenship). Individuals born in India and China are at a disadvantage since the demand for green cards from candidates born in these two countries far exceeds the number of green cards available to them. If any EB-4 or EB-5 green card numbers are not used, they will be moved to the EB-1 green card category. If any EB-1 green card numbers are not used, they will be allotted to the EB-2 category, and if any EB-2 green card numbers are not used (which has not been the case for several years), the remaining will go to the EB-3 category. I often reference two main types of EB-2 category green cards: the EB-2 and the EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver). The EB-2 requires an employer sponsor to file for the time-consuming PERM labor certification process before submitting the EB-2 application to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The EB-2 NIW requires demonstrating that the beneficiary’s work and abilities are in the interest of the U.S. to waive the PERM labor certification process. You can self-petition for the EB-2 NIW or an employer can sponsor you for it. One thing has remained consistent since July 2007: The EB-2 category for individuals born in India (and China, too!) has had a cutoff date. That means there haven’t been enough EB-2 green card numbers for those approved for an EB-2. According to the Visa Bulletin for September 2023, the cutoff date in the EB-2 category for individuals born in India was January 1, 2011. For individuals born in China, it was July 8, 2019, and for individuals in all other countries, it was July 1, 2023. The chart below shows the EB-2 wait times for individuals born in India since 2018. I used data from the USCIS, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (which oversees the USCIS), and the U.S. Department of State, which oversees consular processing and issues the monthly Visa Bulletin. In the chart, the projected wait time of 106 years in 2018 for individuals born in India is lower than the Cato Institute’s 151-year estimate. That’s because the Cato Institute report, which was issued in June 2018, used the latest data available at the time, which was from FY2016 and FY2017. I used FY2018 data. The projected EB-2 wait time hit a high of 221 years, but that’s due to the shutdown of all in-person services in March 2020 at the USCIS and at U.S. embassies and consulates, as well as a hiring freeze, which created significant backlogs. During 2021 and 2022, most U.S. embassies and consulate offices remained closed or had limited operations, which meant many family green cards went unused since most family green card candidates live outside the U.S. This significantly benefited employment-based green card candidates, most of whom are already living and working in the U.S. on a work visa.

2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/firefly-and-millenium-enter-hot-standby-phase-for-high-stakes-space-force-mission/,TechCrunch,Firefly and Millennium enter ‘hot standby phase’ for high-stakes Space Force mission,"The clock is ticking for Firefly Aerospace and Millennium Space Systems, with the two companies announcing today that they have entered the “hot standby phase” for an orbital mission for the U.S. Space Force. The exact launch date of the Victus Nox mission, Firefly’s third mission using the Alpha rocket, is unknown. This is by design: The mission is part of the U.S. Space Force’s initiative to solicit rapid launch capabilities from commercial industry. The two companies will have virtually no notice and very short windows to get a satellite to the launch site and into space. The mission, translated from the Latin for “conquer the night,” is aptly named. At some intentionally unknown time in the next six months, Space Force officials will issue an alert notification to the two teams. From there, Boeing subsidiary Millennium, which built the satellite for the mission, will have 60 hours to transport the spacecraft from Los Angeles to Vandenberg Space Force Base and integrate it with Alpha’s payload adaptor. Once that work is complete, the Space Force will provide Firefly with a launch notice, starting a 24-hour clock. In that period, Firefly must update its trajectory and guidance software with the final orbital requirements, encapsulate the payload, transport it to the pad, attach it to the 95-foot-tall rocket and launch at the first available window. Rapid launch is a capability that is “critical to our national defense,” Lt. Col. MacKenzie Birchenough, Materiel Leader for the Space Force’s Space Safari office, said in a statement. “The accelerated build time the team demonstrated for VICTUS NOX, combined with the demanding launch and on-orbit goals, exemplifies our strong commitment to preserving our nation’s dominance and ability to freely operate in the space domain,” he said. Firefly and Millennium won the contract for the Victus Nox mission in October, with Firefly’s award topping out at $17.6 million. The value of Millennium’s contract was not disclosed."

2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/a-people-first-view-of-the-ai-economy/,TechCrunch,A ‘people-first’ view of the AI economy,"Today marks nine months since ChatGPT was released, and six weeks since we announced our AI Start seed fund. Based on our conversations with scores of inception and early-stage AI founders, and hundreds of leading CXOs (chief experience officers), I can attest that we are definitely in exuberant times. In the span of less than a year, AI investments have become de rigueur in any portfolio, new private company unicorns are being created every week, and the idea that AI will drive a stock market rebound is taking root. People outside of tech are becoming familiar with new vocabulary. Large language models. ChatGPT. Deep-learning algorithms. Neural networks. Reasoning engines. Inference. Prompt engineering. CoPilots. Leading strategists and thinkers are sharing their view on how it will transform business, how it will unlock potential, and how it will contribute to human flourishing. While there are still many unknowns, and it is prudent for us to be aware of the risks as well as the potential of any new technology (“Oppenheimer,” anyone?), one firm conviction makes me optimistic. We are guided by a “people-first” philosophy at Mayfield, one in which the startup founder’s bold vision elevates the customer of their product and ignites a community. When applied to AI, people-first has even more powerful resonance. I believe that two dynamics will combine to establish AI as a powerful force that will allow any human to become what I call Human2 — as in, “human squared.” First, our main form of interacting with computing devices will change. It will become conversational. Whereas we once relied on a command line, then the GUI, the browser, and the mobile device, we are now going to primarily communicate with computers through rich and layered conversations. The impact of that change will be compounded by a second one: For the first time, technology will be able to perform cognitive tasks that augment our own capabilities. Rather than merely speed up and automate repetitive tasks, AI will generate net new things much like humans do. The result is that we’ll be able to multiply our own capabilities with a human-like copilot — or teammate, or coach, or assistant, or genie. AI x Human = Human2. And precisely because the potential and power of AI is so great, the need to focus on responsible development is paramount. We have customized our people-first framework to apply to AI companies and are using it to guide our investment decisions. Today, we are publishing the five key pillars of that framework in the spirit of fostering responsible AI investing: Founding values drive culture. They are not something that can be bolted on as a company grows. We saw this in the missions of three of our most successful companies over the last decade. Lyft was dedicated to improving people’s lives with the best transportation; Poshmark put people at the heart of commerce, empowering everyone to thrive; HashiCorp built critical infrastructure that allowed others to innovate.

			We have customized our ‘people-first’ framework to apply to AI companies and are using it to guide our investment decisions.


This time around, we are having similar discussions with AI-first founders to see if they have a human-centric mission and authentic values. We want to understand what drives their thinking about the impact of their technology and ensure we’re aligned. The recent explosion in AI has been driven by innovative thinking by researchers, model builders, ethicists, and technologists. We believe that founders who have been steeped in that world understand how to design and build people-first AI businesses. So when we meet with founders, we are looking for: As we already know, there are some harmful effects of AI. Some we have identified include hallucinations, poisoning, lack of transparency, inequity, injustice, bias, deep fakes, IP and copyright infringement, and violations of privacy and security. We are asking founders to evaluate the trustworthiness of the models driving their innovation, and encouraging them to look at pioneering work on holistic model evaluation such as that being done at Stanford. We believe founders need to evaluate this not only at the time of model selection but also in the whole lifecycle of a model, from development, to testing, and deployment. At the same time, compliance with the growing regime of regulations, guidelines, and frameworks for the responsible use of AI is paramount. We believe that privacy requires its own focus and cannot just be subsumed under trust and safety. Fortunately, given the myriad of regulations like CCPA, DGA, DMA, DPA, GDPR, PIPA, and PDPO that emerged in recent years, companies are already working on putting data controls in place. This is especially important in the age of generative AI, when models produce new data from training sets, and the unauthorized use of training data has become a significant intellectual property concern. Regulations for the ethical use of data, which provide assurance and risk management, are now emerging across the globe. Governance areas that have to be addressed include discovery and inventory of all data; detection and classification of sensitive data; understanding models access and entitlements by users; consent, legal basis, retention, and residency understanding; and quality and lineage. Paying attention to these things is critical. We are asking founders to do so and encouraging them to build guardrails now. It will be too hard to act once the proverbial data horse has left the barn. We believe that people-first AI will truly elevate humans, and we are working on a design framework to measure that potential when meeting founders. Going back to our company examples, Lyft, Poshmark, and HashiCorp elevated drivers, seller stylists, and cloud practitioners, respectively, enabling them to grow into vibrant communities. They had to make tough decisions to stick with their commitment but ultimately were rewarded by the satisfaction of having achieved their missions of empowering and elevating people. As an inception and early-stage investor, our focus is to champion entrepreneurs and help them build iconic companies. We believe that bringing a people-first approach to fostering generation-defining AI companies will result in enduring companies and a richer, better world."
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/instagram-is-internally-testing-the-ability-to-create-reels-up-to-10-minutes-long/,TechCrunch,Instagram is internally testing the ability to create Reels up to 10 minutes long,"Instagram is internally testing the ability to create Reels that are up to 10 minutes in length, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Wednesday. The social media giant says it is not testing the capability externally. The feature was first uncovered by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who shared screenshots of the internal prototype on X. By increasing the time limit on Reels from three minutes to 10, Instagram would be aligning its short-form video product with TikTok, which expanded its maximum video length to 10 minutes back in February 2022. The change would also put Reels in competition with YouTube. If officially rolled out, the expanded length would give creators more time and flexibility when filming things like cooking demos, beauty tutorials, educational content, comedic sketches and more. Although creators have worked around the three-minute limit by encouraging viewers watch part two of a series, it can be hard to quickly find the correct video. The change would get rid of this problem and make it easier to watch content on the platform. As Instagram and TikTok try to get a piece of the long-form content market, YouTube is looking to further embrace short-form video. Earlier this month, the company announced an expanded suite of creation tools for Shorts. Two weeks later, the company launched a new TikTok-style short-form personalized video feed called “Samples.” Today’s news comes as Instagram has been rolling out a few different updates for its platform. Yesterday, the company revealed that it’s testing a new feature that lets creators share notable fan comments that they have received on posts and Reels to their Stories. Earlier this month, Instagram launched the ability for users to add music to their photo carousels as a way for them to show off their musical taste."
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/chatgpt-maker-openai-accused-of-string-of-data-protection-breaches-in-gdpr-complaint-filed-by-privacy-researcher/,TechCrunch,ChatGPT-maker OpenAI accused of string of data protection breaches in GDPR complaint filed by privacy researcher,"Questions about ChatGPT-maker OpenAI’s ability to comply with European privacy rules are in the frame again after a detailed complaint was filed with the Polish data protection authority yesterday.  The complaint, which TechCrunch has reviewed, alleges the U.S. based AI giant is in breach of the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — across a sweep of dimensions: Lawful basis, transparency, fairness, data access rights, and privacy by design are all areas it argues OpenAI is infringing EU privacy rules. (Aka, Articles 5(1)(a), 12, 15, 16 and 25(1) of the GDPR). Indeed, the complaint frames the novel generative AI technology and its maker’s approach to developing and operating the viral tool as essentially a systematic breach of the pan-EU regime. Another suggestion, therefore, is that OpenAI has overlooked another requirement in the GDPR to undertake prior consultation with regulators (Article 36) — since, if it had conducted a proactive assessment which identified high risks to people’s rights unless mitigating measures were applied it should have given pause for thought. Yet OpenAI apparently rolled ahead and launched ChatGPT in Europe without engaging with local regulators which could have ensured it avoided falling foul of the bloc’s privacy rulebook. This is not the first GDPR concern lobbed in ChatGPT’s direction, of course. Italy’s privacy watchdog, the Garante, generated headlines earlier this year after it ordered OpenAI to stop processing data locally — directing the US-based company to tackle a preliminary list of problems it identified in areas including lawful basis, information disclosures, user controls and child safety. ChatGPT was able to resume offering a service in Italy fairly quickly after it tweaked its presentation. But the Italian DPA’s investigation continues and it remains to be seen what compliance conclusions may emerge once that assessment has been completed. Other EU DPAs are also probing ChatGPT. While, in April, the bloc’s data protection authorities formed a task force, via the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), to collectively consider how they should approach regulating the fast-developing tech. That effort is ongoing — and it’s by no means certain a harmonized approach to oversight of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots will emerge — but, whatever happens there, the GDPR is still law and still in force. So anyone in the EU who feels their rights are being trampled by Big AI grabbing their data for training models that may spit out falsities about them can raise concerns with their local DPA and press for regulators to investigate, as is happening here. OpenAI is not main established in any EU Member State for the purpose of GDPR oversight, which means it remains exposed to regulatory risk in this area across the bloc. So could face outreach from DPAs acting on complaints from individuals anywhere in the bloc. Confirmed violations of the GDPR, meanwhile, can attract penalties as high as 4% of global annual turnover. DPAs’ corrective orders may also end up reworking how technologies function if they wish to continue operating inside the bloc. The 17-page complaint filed yesterday with the Polish DPA is the work of Lukasz Olejnik, a security and privacy researcher, who is being represented for the complaint by Warsaw-based law firm, GP Partners. Olejnik tells TechCrunch he became concerned after he used ChatGPT to generate a biography of himself and found it produced a text that contained some errors. He sought to contact OpenAI, towards the end of March, to point out the errors and ask for the inaccurate information about him to be corrected. He also asked it to provide him with a bundle of information that the GDPR empowers individuals to get from entities processing their data when the information has been obtained from somewhere other than themselves, as was the case here. Per the complaint, a series of email exchanges took place between Olejnik and OpenAI between March and June of this year. And while OpenAI responded by providing some information in response to the Subject Access Request (SAR) Olejnik’s complaint argues it failed to produce all the information it must under the law — including, notably, omitting information about its processing of personal data for AI model training.  Under the GDPR, for personal data processing to be lawful the data controller needs a valid legal basis — which must be transparently communicated. So obfuscation is not a good compliance strategy. Also indeed because the regulation attaches the principle of fairness to the lawfulness of processing, which means anyone playing tricks to try to conceal the true extent of personal data processing is going to fall foul of the law too. Olejnik’s complaint therefore asserts OpenAI breached Article 5(1)(a). Or, more simply, he argues the company processed his data “unlawfully, unfairly, and in a non-transparent manner”. “From the facts of the case, it appears that OpenAI systemically ignores the provisions of the GDPR regarding the processing of data for the purposes of training models within ChatGPT, a result of which, among other things, was that Mr. Łukasz Olejnik was not properly informed about the processing of his personal data,” the complaint notes.  It also accuses OpenAI of acting in an “untrustworthy, dishonest, and perhaps unconscientious manner” by failing to be able to comprehensively detail how it has processed people’s data. “Although OpenAI indicates that the data used to train the [AI] models includes personal data, OpenAI does not actually provide any information about the processing operations involving this data. OpenAI thus violates a fundamental element of the right under Article 15 GDPR, i.e., the obligation to confirm that personal data is being processed,” runs another relevant chunk of the complaint (which has been translated into English from Polish using machine translation). "
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/googles-pixel-8-event-set-for-october-4/,TechCrunch,Google’s Pixel 8 event set for October 4,"We’re rapidly approaching a hardware season for the ages. A day after Apple officially set the date for its iPhone 15 unveiling, Google has planted its Pixel flag. The latest version of the company’s proprietary handset is set for an October 4 debut in New York City. The event will almost certainly debut the upcoming Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro flagship, following I/O’s announcement of the Pixel 7a and Google’s first foldable, the Pixel Fold. If past is precedent (and it usually is), we’ll see a spate of new hardware at the annual fall Made by Google event that will also include the company’s latest wearable, the Pixel Watch 2. Last year’s Pixel Watch was something of a mixed bag, but received overall good marks as Google’s first true Wear OS device. Many of the device’s positives were a direct result of the company’s 2019 Fitbit acquisition. Meanwhile, after a bit of a rocky start, Google’s phone line has been on the glow up since 2021’s Pixel 6 marked a radical shift for the line, with a new premium design, improved optics and the first-party Tensor chip. The leaks have already begun, including early images of the device (it looks an awful lot like the Pixel 7) and word that the Tensor G3 chip will feature nine cores and be built atop the Arm Immortalis architecture. As far as what else to expect, the Pixel Tablet isn’t due for an update, though it’s been a long time since we’ve seen meaningful updates to the Nest/Home line. The company does appear to have deprioritized its smart home offerings, so this could, perhaps, be an opportunity to rectify that in a meaningful way. The event kicks off at 10 AM ET and will be livestreamed over YouTube. We’ll be in there in person, per usual.  "
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/betaworks-goes-all-in-on-augmentative-ai-in-latest-camp-cohort-were-rabidly-interested/,TechCrunch,Betaworks goes all-in on augmentative AI in latest camp cohort: ‘We’re rabidly interested’,"Betaworks is no stranger to investing in artificial intelligence and machine learning, but the latest cohort of their Camp “thematic accelerator” indicates a confidence in the field beyond the present fascination with chatbots. Founder and CEO John Borthwick described the firm as being “rabidly interested” in the field of AI as augmentation rather than just a product in itself. They’re not the only ones, either: “This particular Camp had twice the applicants as last year,” Borthwick told me. “The fun part of these is that you put out an open call, and under that banner, that thesis, you get more diversity than you expect. We believe that over the next two-three years, we’re going to see an incredible amount of companies building and using AI models to augment human workflows and behaviors.” It is perhaps ChatGPT’s most universally useful quality that (assuming you can tell when it’s putting you on) it can quickly and satisfactorily answer a question on nearly any topic, or give a reasonable answer to something like a coding problem. Few talk with AIs just for the pleasure of it (though there are those who do); if it can make your work easier, why not let it? Borthwick noted that Betaworks has been investing in AI and ML since 2016, when it was far more rudimentary. “We started by going systematically through the intersection of ML and a particular modality: machine learning and audio, synthetic media, all those different objects of data or media,” he said. “Over the last year or two we’ve been thinking about the role of AI as it relates to human workflows, and we firmly believe, and want to invest in and move the market towards augmentation.” This is like thinking of AI as “a bicycle for the mind” rather than a purely generative or self-contained product. That’s visible in the selected companies, many of which are or use AI to speed up or improve existing processes rather than do something completely new. Each will receive $500,000 in funding, in addition to anything they’ve already raised. “We’re looking across the AI stack; certain things in this Camp are almost apps, then there are things that are much more in the middleware category,” Borthwick continued. “The program is really about finding product-market fit and developing a product roadmap, it’s less about performative fundraising exercises. About half of the companies do their raise before or during the program.” They brought in three co-investors this year: Greycroft, Differential and Mozilla, all of which will make co-investments and make their resources and networks available to the startups. Betaworks still does all the actual accelerator stuff. Here are the 12 companies in this year’s cohort, summarized from summaries they sent over; I asked each company the most obvious question I could think of (in italics) after hearing what they’re trying to do. In the interest of brevity I have also summarized their sometimes extensive answers. There’s more detail on each, including founders and their backgrounds, over at Betaworks."
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/google-assistant-and-alexa-finally-play-nicely-together-but-only-on-one-speaker-lineup/,TechCrunch,Google Assistant and Alexa finally play nicely together — but only on one speaker lineup,"After years of fierce brawling, Google Assistant and Alexa are finally playing nicely together. Harman today announced new additions to its JBL Authentics speaker lineup that integrate both Google Assistant and Alexa — the first devices on the market to do so. The Authentics 200, Authentics 300 and Authentics 500, all of which sport automatic self-tuning, Bluetooth and multiroom playback, will be available starting on September 17. For years, Google has resisted enabling manufacturers — outside of Sonos, at least — to build smart devices featuring both Google Assistant and Alexa. That’s led Amazon to ramp up the pressure — not necessarily out of a sense of altruism, but to level what it perceived as an uneven playing field. While Alexa has a respectable install base — about 500 million devices as of early this year — Google’s long benefited from shipping Google Assistant as the default assistant on Android smartphones. (This preferential treatment was once the subject of an EU antitrust investigation.) In 2019, Google said that Google Assistant was available on more than 1 billion devices. So in 2019, Amazon launched the Voice Interoperability Initiative, a program aimed at ensuring voice-enabled products such as smart speakers, smartphones and smart displays let users choose among multiple voice assistants. Google, along with Samsung and Apple, declined to join. But now the search giant’s changing its tune. Why? In an email interview, Marissa Chacko, director of product management of Google Assistant, glossed over Amazon and Google’s contemptuous history and seemed to say, in so many words, “why not?” “Voice assistants have become part of our everyday lives,” she said. “Both Google and Amazon wanted to make it easy for users to access either of these voice services simultaneously … We aren’t trying to compensate for capability gaps, but rather give users choice.” On the new JBL Authentics speakers, Google Assistant and Alexa will work interchangeably. Users will be able to ask Alexa to set a timer, for example, and, when it rings, ask Google Assistant to stop it (and vice versa). That’s thanks to what Amazon calls universal device commands (UDC), functionality driven by Amazon’s Multi-Agent Experience Toolkit, which was borne out of the Voice Interoperability Initiative. With UDC, a user can ask Alexa and Google Assistant to stop certain tasks — like music, timers, reminders and alarms — without having to remember which assistant started the request or ask for the request to be handed off to the other assistant. Perhaps just as importantly, the assistants won’t try to speak over one another. The Authentics speakers will automatically change the “audio focus” in the appropriate moment to prevent, for instance, Alexa from speaking over a Google Assistant timer. Amazon and Google have been testing UDC during beta trials, Aaron Rubenson, VP of Alexa, told me via email. “Customers might prefer to access Alexa or Google Assistant to use their favorite Amazon and Google services,” he said. “You might ask Google Assistant for a good substitute for milk, and then ask Alexa to buy it from Amazon.com. Or, get an Amazon package delivery notification from Alexa, and then ask Google Assistant to add a reminder about the delivery to your Google Calendar.” But aren’t Google and Amazon concerned about engagement with either Google Assistant or Alexa suffering now that both assistants are on one device? Apparently, no. In a remarkable change in tune, Rubenson and Chacko say that they see the assistants as being “complementary” rather than competitive with each other. “While we of course want to increase engagement with Alexa, the focus of this integration is to create a great customer experience where customers have seamless access to both assistants,” Rubenson said. “We fully expect customers to use Alexa and Google Assistant on their own or alongside each other on the JBL Authentics 200, 300, and 500 speakers.” Chacko added: “We believe in creating a strong smart home ecosystem, and ultimately want to make it easier for people to have access to their preferred assistants … We know that many households have mixed voice assistant preferences and several devices, which can be difficult to manage. Along with Amazon and Harman, we had a shared vision for this integration to provide users value and choice by delivering simultaneous access to multiple voice assistants on a single device.” But there’s important subtext. Smart speaker sales have been in decline for some time. Shipments were down 30% in Q1 2023, the sixth quarterly consecutive dip. And according to a survey by UpCity, a business-to-business service directory, only half of U.S. consumers are using voice search daily. The stakes are lower than they used to be, simply put — especially in light of both Amazon and Google internally scaling back their voice assistant efforts. Amazon was reportedly on pace to lose about $10 billion on Alexa and other devices in 2022 alone. And Google has ramped down its investments in Google Assistant both for third-party devices and its own hardware lineup, recently stripping third-party voice games and apps from Nest hub smart displays. Declining sales likely aren’t the only reason to blame for the shifting corporate priorities. As it turns out, it’s hard to make money with voice assistants. Amazon is said to have raked in less than $2 million on Alexa apps in 2019, falling well short of the company’s $5 million target. But be all this as it may, the Harman/Amazon collaboration could end up being a one-off. Chacko wouldn’t commit to future Google Assistant and Alexa integrations, implying that it’ll depend on how this one’s received. “It’s early to determine this integration’s impact,” she said. “While we don’t have any plans to share about future integrations, we’re excited to see how …. [users] utilize having simultaneous access to both Google Assistant and Alexa at home.” In other words, it’s a temporary alliance — not a lasting truce."
2023-08-30,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/artificial-intelligence-lean-startups/,TechCrunch,Steve Blank: AI will revolutionize the ‘lean startup’,"  As you’ll have noted from our coverage, as far as startup land is concerned, AI is hot, hot, hot. Meanwhile, the lean methodology — think of a hypothesis, test it, iterate on it — has been canon for entrepreneurs and founders the world over for the past decade. But AI will most likely play a role in building startups faster, cheaper and more efficiently. So I asked the man who invented the concept of the lean startup, Steve Blank, to see what he thinks. AI might not have started with ChatGPT, but the ability for the general public to interact with generative AI on a wide scale did. But even still, Blank says we’re collectively underestimating the potential of generative AI. “I’m surprised no one has done a parody of actually reviewing a three-month-old baby,” Blank said, “and saying all it does is poop in its pants, and it can’t even finish complete sentences, rather than going, ‘Holy shit! This is like the first week of this thing’s life!’ and we really don’t realize it.” And, just like a three-month-old, nobody can fully predict what ChatGPT has in store for us next. “Copilot has changed the life of every programmer, period, who writes software,” Blank said. “It’s probably increased productivity by 50%, and that’s if you’re using it poorly. That’s a mind-blower.” Blank highlights how AI-assisted research has made leaps of progress in the form of AlphaFold, a project that is trying to translate proteins into their three-dimensional structures, which can help us understand processes in the body, including aging. AI, obviously, goes far beyond, and we’ve only just started to see the tremendous evolution that will span all sciences. Blank might be on to something: Just last week, researchers at University College, London and Moorfields Eye Hospital in the U.K. identified markers for Parkinson’s disease in eye scans using AI. That kind of diagnosis might’ve taken years without the help of AI. Blank is wide-eyed about where it can yet go, considering how much money is being thrown at AI projects without much VC scrutiny. And to him, the concept of the “lean startup” is about to change forever. “I just think it’s going to be an amazing ride,” he said. “Part of the amazing ride, let’s go back to the VC part, is that the dumb money is just poured into it. Think about it: There’s probably 10,000 experiments being run with capital. It’s not 10,000 experiments being run in your basement; there’s a ton of stuff that’s been thrown against the wall to see if any bit sticks.”  "
2023-08-29,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/phonepe-dives-into-stock-and-mutual-fund-arena/,TechCrunch,PhonePe dives into stock and mutual fund arena,"India’s PhonePe is getting into stock and mutual fund investment, the latest in a series of expansions by the Walmart-backed payments app as it looks to leverage its 450 million-plus user base to win in new categories. The Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which has raised $850 million in recent quarters, launched an app called Share.Market on Wednesday that will allow users to open their trading accounts and invest in stocks, mutual funds and ETFs. Stock broking is the latest offering from PhonePe, which also recently expanded to e-commerce with an app called Pincode. The firm, valued at $12 billion, is also looking to launch an app store, TechCrunch previously reported. With Share.Market, PhonePe is entering a crowded market that is attempting to serve an audience of about 10 million to 15 million, according to most estimates. Zerodha, a bootstrapped startup, currently leads the stock-broking market and is planning to enter the mutual fund space. Peak XV–backed Groww, Mirae Asset–backed Dhan, Steadview Capital–backed INDmoney, Tiger Global–backed Upstox, and Amazon-backed Smallcase are other formidable players in the category. PhonePe is attempting to differentiate itself in the new space by aggressively discounting the broking price — 24 cents or 0.05%, whichever is lower — and offering broader quantitative research and trading strategies, it said. “In the last few years, we have seen an increase in the percentage of savings going into equities in a big way. There is a vibrant growth in the active trading community which trades with different objectives. We believe Share.Market will propel this growth with the backing of our technological prowess, reach, seamless onboarding, and superior product experience,” said Ujjwal Jain, chief executive of Share.Market, in a statement. The 2021 bull market enticed a significant number of Indians to venture into stock investments for the first time. Wealth management is also gaining traction in India. Jio Financial Services, the financial arm of the Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries, forged a partnership with the U.S. asset management giant BlackRock. This joint venture aims to present diverse investment opportunities to Indians. “Our goal is to offer the benefits of discount broking while creating lasting value for our customers as they invest and trade. We will continue to invest in advanced technology, data, research, and immersive experiences to offer these benefits at scale and drive this new era of value led discount broking coupling intelligence with broking,” said Stock.Market’s Jain."
2023-08-29,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/general-motors-to-use-google-ai-chatbot-for-its-onstar-service/,TechCrunch,General Motors to use Google AI chatbot for its OnStar service,"General Motors has found a new way to get in on the generative AI buzz. The automaker is now using Google Cloud’s conversational chatbot, dubbed Dialogflow, to handle some non-emergency OnStar features. GM announced the collaboration alongside a keynote from Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai at the Google Cloud Next 23 event Tuesday. OnStar, GM’s in-car concierge, has been powered by intent-recognition algorithms that use Google Cloud’s conversational AI since launch in 2022. Today’s advancements allow it to provide drivers with responses to common queries like routing and navigation assistance. The move to up-skill OnStar’s capabilities is in line with GM’s greater vision to build a $25 billion subscription business by 2030. “Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the buying, ownership and interaction experience inside the vehicle and beyond, enabling more opportunities to deliver new features and services,” said Mike Abbott, executive vice president of software and services at GM. “Our software-led approach has accelerated the creation of compelling services for our customers while driving increased efficiency across the GM enterprise. The work with Google Cloud is another example of our efforts to transform how customers engage with our products and services.” Since 2019, GM has been building new vehicles with Google built-in, meaning the cars are built with Google Assistant, Maps and Play, accessible directly from the vehicles’ infotainment systems. In April, the automaker said it would phase out Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which allow drivers to mirror their smartphone screens in the vehicle’s dashboard display, in favor of Google built-in.  GM says that with the help of Dialogflow, its OnStar virtual assistant is now fielding more than 1 million customer inquiries per month in the U.S. and Canada. The service is available in most model year 2015 and newer GM vehicles.  The chatbot has helped OnStar better understand a customer’s request the first time it’s spoken and can respond with a “modern, natural sounding voice,” according to GM. Aside from routing and turn-by-turn directions, OnStar’s chatbot can help with simple questions from the non-emergency OnStar blue button in GM vehicles. GM says the chatbot can also catch phrases and words that may signify an emergency situation and quickly route the call to a human advisor. Dialogflow can also answer customer questions about GM vehicles and product features based on technical information from the automaker’s vehicle data caches. Customers can ask the bot about GM’s new 2024 EV lineup or how to use new tech features in their vehicles. "

2023-08-29,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/deepmind-partners-with-google-cloud-to-watermark-ai-generated-images/,TechCrunch,DeepMind partners with Google Cloud to watermark AI-generated images,"In partnership with Google Cloud, Google DeepMind (Google’s AI research division) is launching a tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated images — but only images created by Google’s image-generating model. The tool, called SynthID and available in beta for select users of Vertex AI (Google’s platform for building AI apps and models) embeds a digital watermark directly into the pixels of an image — making it ostensibly imperceptible to the human eye but detectable by an algorithm. SynthID only supports Imagen, Google’s text-to-image model, which is exclusively available in Vertex AI. Google previously said it would embed metadata to signal visual media created by generative AI models. SynthID, obviously, goes a step beyond this. “While generative AI can unlock huge creative potential, it also presents new risks, like enabling creators to spread false information — both intentionally or unintentionally,” DeepMind writes in a blog post. “Being able to identify AI-generated content is critical to empowering people with knowledge of when they’re interacting with generated media, and for helping prevent the spread of misinformation.” Image Credits: DeepMind DeepMind claims that SynthID, which it developed and partnered with Google Research (Google’s R&D team) to refine, remains in place even after modifications like adding filters to images or changing the colors of and highly compressing images. The tool leverages two AI models, one for watermarking and one for identifying, that were trained together on a “diverse” set of images, DeepMind says. SynthID can’t identify watermarked images with 100% confidence. But the tool distinguishes between instances where an image might contain a watermark versus an image that is highly likely to contain one. “SynthID isn’t foolproof against extreme image manipulations, but it does provide a promising technical approach for empowering people and organisations to work with AI-generated content responsibly,” DeepMind writes in the blog post. “This tool could also evolve alongside other AI models and modalities beyond imagery such as audio, video and text.” Watermarking techniques for generative art aren’t new. French startup Imatag, launched in 2020, offers a watermarking tool that it claims isn’t affected by resizing, cropping, editing or compressing images, similar to SynthID. Another firm, Steg.AI, employs an AI model to apply watermarks that survive resizing and other edits. But the pressure is ramping up on tech firms to provide a way to make it clear that works were generated by AI. Recently, China’s Cyberspace Administration issued regulations requiring that generative AI vendors mark generated content — including text and image generators — without affecting user usage. And in recent U.S. Senate committee hearings, Senator Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ)  emphasized the need for transparency in generative AI, including by using watermarks. In May at its annual Build conference, Microsoft committed to watermarking AI-generated images and videos “using cryptographic methods.” Elsewhere, Shutterstock and generative AI startup Midjourney adopted guidelines to embed a marker indicating that content was created by a generative AI tool. And OpenAI’s DALL-E 2, a text-to-image tool, inserts a small watermark on the bottom right-hand side of images that it generates. But so far, a common watermarking standard — both for creating watermarks and detecting them — has proven to be elusive. SynthID, like the other technologies that’ve been proposed, won’t be useful for any image generator that isn’t Imagen — at least not in its current form. DeepMind says that it’s considering making SynthID available to third parties in the near future. But whether third parties — especially third parties developing open source AI image generators, which lack many of the guardrails in generators gated behind an API — will adopt the tech is another matter altogether."
2023-08-29,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/nhtsa-raises-more-concerns-about-teslas-autopilot-safety/,TechCrunch,NHTSA raises more concerns about Tesla’s Autopilot safety,"Once again, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is requesting more information from Tesla regarding the safety of Autopilot. In a special order dated July 26, the regulator shared concerns about a change to Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system that allows drivers to use the system for extended periods of time without prompting the driver to place their hands on the steering wheel. NHTSA ordered Tesla to answer questions and produce documents, according to the letter released Tuesday. The special order is part of NHTSA’s ongoing investigations into Autopilot after identifying more than a dozen crashes in which Tesla vehicles hit parked emergency vehicles. The agency is also actively looking into whether Teslas can make sure drivers are paying attention when using Autopilot. This isn’t the first time NHTSA has requested information about Tesla’s driver monitoring systems (DMS), which are meant to ensure drivers are paying attention to the road while automated driving systems are engaged. In August 2022, the agency asked Tesla to answer questions about its cabin camera as part of an ongoing probe into 830,000 Teslas that include Autopilot. Tesla says the camera is built with a DMS that can determine if a driver isn’t paying attention and send them noise alerts. Tesla previously relied on a system that could detect when a driver’s hands were on the steering wheel, but introduced the camera-based DMS in May 2021. NHTSA asked for more information about the DMS in July, as well as information on how Tesla generates its quarterly safety reports. “The resulting relaxation of controls designed to ensure that the driver remained engaged in the dynamic driving task could lead to greater driver inattention and failure of the driver to properly supervise Autopilot,” reads NHTSA’s July letter to Tesla. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared plans on X — the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk bought in 2022 — to gradually reduce alerts aimed at ensuring drivers using Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system keep their hands on the wheel. Tesla has been ordered to provide information on when the software update was introduced, how many vehicles were affected, Tesla’s reason for installing it and any plans to enable the software in the next year. NHTSA gave Tesla a due date of August 25, and late responses can cost $26,315 per day. NHTSA did not respond in time to TechCrunch to confirm that Tesla met its deadline. The order from NHTSA comes as Tesla faces back-to-back lawsuits this fall. The first, scheduled for September in a California state court, contains allegations that Autopilot caused a vehicle to suddenly veer off a highway at 65 miles per hour, hit a tree and burst into flames, killing the owner of the vehicle. The second is set for October, and concerns the death of a Miami driver whose Model 3 drove under the trailer of a truck that had pulled onto the road, slicing off the top of the car’s roof and killing the driver. The lawsuit alleges that Autopilot failed to brake, steer or act in any way to avoid the crash."
2023-08-29,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/starfish-space-pulls-otter-pup-servicing-vehicle-back-from-the-brink-of-death/,TechCrunch,Starfish Space pulls Otter Pup servicing vehicle back from ‘the brink of death’,"Against all odds, Starfish Space has managed to pull its first orbital mission back from the brink of catastrophe, with the startup saying Tuesday that it has regained control over the Otter Pup spacecraft that had been rapidly tumbling through space. The Kent, Washington–based startup said it will now move ahead with an “extensive checkout” of the spacecraft’s onboard systems and a search for a new partner for its rendezvous, proximity and docking (RPD) mission. The mission seemed doomed to failure back in June. Starfish was one of several companies that hitched a ride to orbit on a space tug operated by Launcher (now owned by Vast). But shortly after reaching low Earth orbit, Launcher mission commanders made the decision to emergency deploy all onboard payloads after the space tug experienced a glitch that caused it to start to rapidly tumble. While that emergency deployment gave Otter Pup a chance to survive, it sent the spacecraft tumbling, too — at a rotation rate of excess of almost one full rotation per second, as opposed to the rate of one or two degrees per second that spacecraft are designed for. While the rotation rate started to slowly decline on its own, due to electromagnetic and atmospheric drag, the company realized it wouldn’t be enough to fully slow the spacecraft. So, they got to work conceiving, developing, and eventually executing a plan to use the spacecraft’s magnetic torque rods to essentially “push off” from Earth’s atmosphere and gradually decrease tumble. Starfish engineers managed the feat against some challenging conditions. In a statement released Tuesday, the startup details how Otter Pup experienced a series of low power events that “pushed it to the brink of death.” Starfish said it worked with its mission partners Astro Digital, the satellite chassis manufacturer, and Advanced Solutions Inc., a Rocket Lab subsidiary, to reorient the spacecraft so it could recharge itself. Provided that Otter Pup receives a full bill of health, Starfish now needs to find another partner for its mission. It had originally planned to demonstrate Otter Pup’s RPD capabilities with Launcher’s space tug — though that is obviously no longer possible."

In its latest report on what Meta calls “coordinated inauthentic behavior” — usually covert state-sponsored social media campaigns designed to shape public opinion — the company detailed the discovery of a huge network of fake accounts, pages and groups pushing positive talking points about China. On Facebook alone, Meta removed 7,704 accounts, 954 pages and 15 groups linked to the disinformation operation. According to the report, the activity amounted to “what appears to be the largest known cross-platform covert influence operation in the world.” The campaign wasn’t limited to Facebook and Instagram, with a footprint that touched 50 other platforms, including X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, Medium and many other smaller sites. “This network typically posted positive commentary about China and its province Xinjiang and criticisms of the United States, Western foreign policies, and critics of the Chinese government including journalists and researchers,” Meta’s researchers wrote. While such a large disinformation campaign is alarming, this particular effort didn’t gain much traction in spite of its size. The activity was based in China but sought to influence Chinese speakers outside of China as well as target audiences in Taiwan, the United States, Australia, the U.K. and Japan. In the process, the campaign took over Facebook pages known for posting spam, but these accounts were characterized by fake engagement originating in Vietnam, Bangladesh and Brazil, not the disinformation network’s intended targets. In spite of its size, the influence campaign’s clumsy efforts didn’t result in much success: Researchers were able to connect the campaign to “Spamouflage,” a known China-based campaign operating for years now. While Meta is generally careful about ascribing influence campaigns to governments, the company did not hesitate to state that this one has firm ties to Chinese law enforcement."
2023-08-29,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/meta-avatars-are-finally-getting-legs-in-beta/,TechCrunch,Meta avatars are finally getting legs (in beta),"It’s time to beta test Meta’s greatest technological innovation since the News Feed: legs. Now on Meta Quest headsets, you can download an update that lets you walk on two feet, just like our ancient ancestor, the Ardipithecus ramidus, an early hominid that achieved bipedality 4.4 million years ago. Now it comes full circle. When Meta launched its suite of virtual reality social products, its avatars did not have legs, instead hovering as disembodied torsos. Now our digital likenesses can finally get back on their feet. So far, users report that they only have legs in Horizon Home, the area where you find yourself when you first turn on your headset. While Quest headsets support hand tracking, a technology that allows users to essentially use their hands instead of controllers, it doesn’t track leg and foot movements. This makes it harder to create legged avatars that feel at least a little bit natural. Early testers say that you can only see legs in third person, not first person, which is supposed to make the visual a little less jarring.s Mark Zuckerberg first announced that Meta was working on legs last October. Perhaps now this feature will get up and running before Meta’s next Connect event in September."

2023-08-29,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/twitch-partner-plus-program-tiers-points/,TechCrunch,Twitch just made it a little easier to qualify for the Partner Plus program,"Earlier this summer, Twitch offered some good news to streamers frustrated with the platform’s default revenue share, which splits earnings between the company and the creator 50/50. With the launch of Twitch’s new Partner Plus program, streamers could soon qualify to take home 70% of their earnings instead — but that better deal came with a few pretty major caveats. To qualify for Partner Plus, Twitch requires that streamers maintain a minimum of 350 paid subscribers for three straight months. The requirement is steep considering how difficult it can be to build traction on the site and doesn’t improve things for new streamers just starting out. Now, Twitch is making one change to the Partner Plus program, though it isn’t the one that most people asked for. This week, Twitch announced that higher subscription tiers will count for extra toward meeting the 350 paid subscriber requirement. On Twitch, paid subscribers get special perks, including ad-free streams, chat badges, subscriber-only chat access and special subscriber streams. While less common, more expensive Tier 2 and Tier 3 subs offer a channel’s fans special badge flair and extra emotes that show up in chat. Now, Tier 1 subs count as one point, Tier 2 subs count for two points and Tier 3 subs count for six points. The 350-subscriber requirement is now the total number of “Partner Plus points” that a streamer needs to qualify for the program. While that change will give some streamers a boost, many streamers are still calling on Twitch to make gifted subs count toward the 350 paid subscriptions requirement. (Amazon Prime members also get one free channel subscription each month, but Twitch doesn’t count these subs toward the Partner Plus requirements either.) Twitch has a huge culture of gift subs, where a channel’s existing subscribers pay to give another viewer a free subscription, supporting their favorite streamers and bringing people into the community in the process. Twitch’s big subscriber event known as “Subtember” is just around the corner too, offering discounts on subscriptions and gift subs. Channels that do manage to clear the 350 subscriber hurdle will be enrolled in the more favorable revenue share for 12 months, even if their paid subscriber base falls below the threshold afterward. For streamers who make the cut, the first $100,000 they earn on the platform will be divvied up 70/30, but earnings default back to 50/50 once they cross that mark. Twitch’s Partner Plus program launches on October 1 — right around the corner — so we’ll be watching to see how the new revenue share plays out and how many streamers actually manage to clear the bar to get it."
2023-08-29,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/as-appeals-court-rules-in-favor-of-grayscale-a-bitcoin-spot-etf-could-be-on-the-horizon/,TechCrunch,"As appeals court rules in favor of Grayscale, a bitcoin spot ETF could be on the horizon","The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of Grayscale, a digital asset management firm, in a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the matter of a bitcoin ETF, according to a legal filing on Tuesday. This ruling is in response to Grayscale’s lawsuit against the SEC, which denied the firm’s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange traded fund (ETF) on June 29, 2022. “The denial of Grayscale’s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,” the filing stated. “We therefore grant Grayscale’s petition and vacate the order.” The court ruled 3-0 in favor of Grayscale, which currently owns 3.4% of outstanding bitcoin, “worth tens of billions of dollars,” according to the filing. To many in the crypto space, the ruling represents a huge victory. The news was so welcome that within minutes of the courts’ ruling on Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price rose over 7% to nearly $28,000. “This judicial decision is a monumental step for the whole cryptocurrency sector, including Grayscale,” Yusuf Sevim, CEO of blockchain tech-focused Metatime, told TechCrunch. “It gives a legal and financial stamp of approval, encouraging more traditional investors to venture into the space.” It also set an “encouraging example” that could affect financial markets beyond the United States, Sevim said. That’s not hyperbole. A company being able to offer a bitcoin spot ETF could allow folks in the traditional financial world to buy into the crypto market using their existing investing services — companies like Fidelity and Vanguard that may hold retirement assets, for example. Bringing bitcoin to the TradFi market in a manner that is already well-understood from an operational, trading and fee perspective has the potential to unlock lots of demand for the cryptocurrency in the near-term. Such interest could lead to the ETF in question buying more total bitcoin to meet demand, shifting crypto’s supply equation. More demand with flat supply would send the price up, in other words. When Grayscale’s application was denied a little more than a year ago, Michael Sonnenshein, the company’s CEO, stated that he was “deeply disappointed” and “vehemently disagree[d]” with the SEC’s decision. Today, Sonnenshein is singing a different tune. “This is a monumental step forward for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,” said Jennifer Rosenthal, a spokeswoman for Grayscale. This is the latest blow in a series of “losses” for the SEC. Last month, a federal court ruled partially in favor of Ripple Labs and its XRP token, stating that the cryptocurrency is not a security when it comes to public sales but could be considered one in some cases for institutional sales. The SEC is appealing the decision. "

2023-08-29,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/fbi-operation-qakbot-uninstall/,TechCrunch,FBI operation tricked thousands of computers infected by Qakbot into uninstalling the malware,"A U.S. government operation has dismantled the infrastructure of the notorious Qakbot malware, which officials say caused “hundreds of millions” of dollars of damage worldwide. In an announcement on Tuesday, the FBI said that it had successfully “disrupted and dismantled” the Qakbot malware, and had identified more than 700,000 infected computers worldwide — including more than 200,000 in the United States. The Department of Justice also announced the seizure of more than $8.6 million in cryptocurrency from the Qakbot cybercriminal organization, which will now be made available to victims. The operation, which was carried out in partnership with law enforcement agencies in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Latvia and the United Kingdom, is described as the largest U.S.-led financial and technical disruption of a botnet infrastructure leveraged by cybercriminals to commit ransomware, financial fraud and other cyber-enabled criminal activity. To dismantle the botnet, the FBI gained lawful access to Qakbot’s infrastructure and redirected Qakbot traffic to FBI-controlled servers, which instructed infected computers to download an uninstaller file. This uninstaller was created by law enforcement to untether the victims’ computers from the Qakbot botnet, preventing further installation of malware through Qakbot. During this operation, named “Operation Duck Hunt,” the FBI said it recovered the stolen credentials — including email addresses and passwords — of more than 6.5 million victims, adding that its international partners identified “millions more.” The FBI also announced the seizure of 52 servers, which it said would “permanently dismantle” the botnet. Qakbot, also known as “QBot” and “QuakBot,” was first detected in 2008, making it one of the longest-running botnets. The malware, which first emerged as a banking trojan, infects devices primarily through phishing emails containing malicious links or attachments. Once a target taps the link or downloads the attachment, Qakbot would deploy additional malware to their computer to become part of a botnet network that could be controlled remotely. In recent years, Qakbot become the botnet of choice for some of the most infamous ransomware gangs, including Conti, ProLock, Egregor, REvil, MegaCortex and Black Basta These ransomware gangs received approximately $58 million in ransom payments in the last 18 months alone, according to the FBI, and combined racked up more than 40 victims, including healthcare providers and government agencies. According to today’s announcement, these victims include a power engineering firm based in Illinois; financial services organizations based in Alabama, Kansas and Maryland; a defense manufacturer based in Maryland; and a food distribution company in Southern California. The U.S. State Department’s Rewards for Justice program has announced rewards of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification of Qakbot operators. Read more on TechCrunch:"

Discovery-owned streaming service previously called HBO Max, announced a 60-day streaming deal with AMC that will bring AMC+ programming to the streamer. Beginning on September 1, Max will launch a branded hub “AMC+ Picks on Max” on both the ad-free and ad-supported tiers. The hub will feature seven AMC+ shows, including “Fear the Walking Dead” (Seasons 1-7), “Killing Eve” (Seasons 1-4), “Gangs of London” (Seasons 1 and 2), “Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire,” “Dark Winds,” “A Discovery of Witches” (Seasons 1- 3) and “Ride with Norman Reedus” (Seasons 1-5). The titles will remain on Max for two months. Notably, subscribers with the ad-supported plan won’t see any commercials when watching the AMC+ series. Like WBD’s licensing deal with Netflix, the AMC+ programming will continue to be on AMC’s streaming service. Last month, Netflix announced that it would stream HBO shows such as “Insecure,” “Band of Brothers,” “The Pacific,” “Six Feet Under” and “Ballers.” The new deal comes as WBD continues to improve and experiment with its relaunched platform. The company revealed last week that it plans to add 24/7 livestreaming news from CNN.

The new app aims to bring a retro gaming experience to iOS users with a collection of mini-games reminiscent of classic arcade-style or electric handheld titles. Included in the debut lineup are “Ollie Soars,” a Flappy Bird-like game where you fly around the world collecting gems while also soaring past obstacles; “Snake,” a familiar game where you try to gobble up apples while avoiding running into your snake’s own twists and turns; and “Tranquility Touchdown,” a space exploration game where you pilot your lander to the surface of six different planets. Image Credits: Iconfactory The team says they wanted to recapture the magic of the classic games they played in their youth, citing favorite titles like “Asteroids,” “Moon Patrol,” “Battlezone” and handheld games like “Mattel Football,” “Simon” and “Merlin.” With Ollie’s Arcade, players have a chance to “turn their iPhone or iPad into a retro gaming experience,” the company’s announcement states. Image Credits: Iconfactory Plus, two of the new titles — “Ollie Soars” and “Tranquility Touchdown” — were inspired by Easter Eggs in Twitterific, Iconfactory’s long-lost Twitter app that was a casualty of Elon Musk’s API changes that put third-party Twitter clients out of business. “Ollie Soars,” an Easter egg introduced into Twitterific 5 in 2016, was completely revamped for the launch of the new app, while Tranquility Touchdown was touched up and polished for the release. The team then added their own take on the classic “Snake” game to round out the trio. Image Credits: Iconfactory The games can be played on your phone or even with a game controller or wireless keyboard, the company notes. All of the mini-games are ad-free and subscription-free — the app is a free download that includes “Ollie Soars,” and you can unlock the other two games with a one-time purchase of $1.99 each."

Apple’s next iPhone event is scheduled for September 12. The firm just sent out invites for the event, once again scheduled for its Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino. The invite features a Thanos snap-like graphic (spoilers), accompanied by the word “Wonderlust” [sic]. The iPhone 15 will almost certainly be the centerpiece for the big show. Given the big deal it made for the iPhone X, it seems like the new version of the handset could bring a big upgrade to the line. Given how the overall market has been trending, a much needed injection of excitement could go a long way. Likely not a foldable-level of excitement, but excitement, nonetheless. Speaking of legislation, Apple also recently threw its weight behind a right to repair bill currently making its way through California state legislation. A recent shift toward supporting self-repair could find the company touting the new phone’s repairability. It would be a massive shift in direction from the company’s historical stance, but stranger things have certainly happened. Other tipped rumors include slimmer bezels and the addition of the Dynamic Island across the line. The Apple Watch Series 9 is also a slam dunk for the show. We haven’t seen a ton in the way of rumors, though reports have pointed toward the inclusion of the A15 Bionic chip, along with a new pink addition. Barbie-branding, anyone? Pink is apparently on the list with iPhone 15 colors, as well, along with new blue and gray versions. We expect the public versions of the latest iOS, macOS and watchOs to drop at the same time. This will also be Apple’s second major opportunity to show off the Vision Pro, ahead of its launch early next year. We’ll likely be getting a better look at some of the content arriving for the “spatial computing” headset, along with additional information on Apple’s biggest gambit in a decade. "

And yet, the world of fintech is an ever-evolving one with entrepreneurs trying to modernize financial services, simplify payments and embed financial products everywhere. That’s why we added a Fintech Stage to TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 — and invited some of the brightest minds in fintech to learn how they pulled it off. Today, we’re thrilled to announce that the Fintech Stage agenda is at full capacity! We’ll discuss the future of payments, open banking, embedded finance and . . . well, check out all the fintech topics for yourself below. (Go here for the full Disrupt agenda.) Creating a bank account, storing money, receiving a payment card and lending money should be as easy as opening an account on a social network. Or at least, that’s the promise of embedded finance. That’s why a new wave of finance infrastructure companies are reinventing banking — and they could potentially turn any company into a fintech company. With Peter Hazlehurst, co-founder and CEO, Synctera; Laura Spiekerman, co-founder and president, Alloy; and Amanda Swoverland, chief compliance officer, Unit. Payments startup Checkout.com cashed in on the tech funding boom of 2021 and reached a valuation of $40 billion. Since then, both Stripe and Checkout.com had to lower their internal valuations. But Checkout.com president Céline Dufétel is here to prove that the payments company is still in growth mode and has big expectations for the U.S. in particular. With Céline Dufétel, president and COO, Checkout.com. Plaid has had a thousand lives. After a $5 billion acquisition deal with Visa that fell through due to regulatory concerns, the company didn’t hit the pause button. Instead, it has been relentlessly rolling out features and raising money to make the dream of open banking a reality. What if you could connect to your bank account from anywhere? What if sending money was as easy as sending a text message? With Zach Perret, co-founder and CEO, Plaid. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank left a hole in the world of startup banking that numerous startups and big banks alike are trying to fill. Hear from some of the players that have stepped in to help fill that gap about what they are doing to offer startups and investors meaningful alternatives in this post-SVB world. With Immad Akhund, co-founder and CEO, Mercury; Wendy Cai-Lee, founder and CEO, Piermont Bank; and Melissa Smith, co-head of Innovation Economy, head of Specialized Industries, Commercial Banking, JPMorgan. Robinhood was founded 10 years ago with a mission to give more people, not just the wealthy, access to the financial markets. It has since grown to offer more than just stock trading. People can now also use Robinhood to trade crypto, save for retirement and manage their cash. The company found itself the subject of controversy in early 2021 when it decided to freeze trades for GameStop. It has since recovered but other challenges remain. What’s next for the popular trading app? With Vlad Tenev, co-founder and CEO, Robinhood. Yes, there are still crypto-focused investors out there doubling down their web3 strategies as other VCs look to other horizons (ahem, AI). Arianna Simpson is a general partner deploying capital for a16z’s multi-billion-dollar crypto fund(s). While other investors move away from the crypto industry amid the market downturn, we want to learn about why and how a16z is holding on to their strategy, how they view the investing landscape and more. We’ll also dive into what the regulatory landscape means for VCs and the projects they invest in. With Arianna Simpson, general partner, a16z crypto. As the crypto ecosystem gains more traction from developers, traditional institutions and big brands, it needs mainstream adoption to grow as well. In order to do that, blockchains need to be able to support greater — and faster — transactions per second, while keeping fees low. But what will it take to get to that next level? And what are major blockchains and crypto projects alike doing to help accelerate that mission? With Mo Shaikh, co-founder and CEO, Aptos Labs; Grace Torrellas, VP of product, Polygon Labs; and Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder, Solana Labs. Fintech Investing Is Not for the Faint of Heart Venture capitalists have poured billions into fintech companies in recent years, making it one of the most invested categories in the startup world. While the pace of funding has slowed, there are plenty of investors who are still bullish on the potential of financial technology. What sectors within fintech show the most promise? Which have seen too much hype? Which have proven to be resilient? With Mark Fiorentino, partner, Index Ventures; Emmalyn Shaw, co-founder and managing partner, Flourish Ventures; and Jillian Williams, partner, Cowboy Ventures.

Exit volume for startups has been weak since the end of the 2021, but it’s easy to become inured to new market conditions and lose track of just how long they have dragged on — and how different they are from what came before. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Crunchbase data indicates that billion-dollar exits — the sort of startup liquidity event that the onset of the unicorn era post-2013 rendered requisite instead of exotically exceptional — began to fall in frequency in the final quarter of 2021. The decline in the pace of billion-dollar exits for American companies includes a drop from 71 in the third quarter of 2021 to 45 in the final quarter of that year; 19 in Q1 2022; and just 17 in the rest of the year.

2023-08-29,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/gitai-closes-additional-funding-in-advance-of-demo-mission-outside-the-iss/,TechCrunch,Gitai closes additional funding in advance of demo mission outside the ISS,"Space robotics startup Gitai has closed an additional $15 million in funding, a little over three months after announcing a $30 million Series B extension round to advance its technology for the moon. The new funding will enable the company to increase its California-based headcount and grow its relationships with NASA, commercial space companies based in the U.S. and the Department of Defense, Gitai CEO Sho Nakanose said. Gitai, which also has offices in Japan, aims to provide the labor force for space: inexpensive robots capable of constructing and maintaining space colonies and other infrastructure. Its first products are a two-meter-long “inchworm” robotic arm designed specifically for use in space stations, and a lunar rover to enable infrastructure development. When combined, Gitai says the arm-plus-robot will be capable of performing many of the requisite tasks to explore the moon and build a lunar base, including excavation, inspection, assembly and welding. The seven-year-old company tests many of its technologies in simulated environments, including a simulated lunar surface environment in the Mojave Desert and a mock moon regolith chamber at its California office. Gitai has also completed technology demonstration aboard the International Space Station’s Nanoracks Bishop Airlock, where one of the startup’s autonomous robots successfully executed simple capabilities like structure assembly and operating switches and cables.  As a next step, the company is preparing to deploy a 1.5-meter-long autonomous robotic arm system called “S2” outside the Airlock next year. Provided that the arm passes NASA’s final safety review, Gitai aims to launch the robot on a cargo resupply mission scheduled for December. The company is also in discussions to send its rover and inch worm to the moon as soon as 2026, to demonstrate the construction of communication antennas and solar panels, Nakanose said. This most recent funding includes participation from Japanese firms Green Co-Invest Investment Limited Partnership, Pacific Bays Capital’s Pacific Bays Fund 1 & 1A Investment Limited Partnerships, and MSIVC 2021V Venture Capital Investment Limited Partnership. Gitai also secured funding via a loan from Japanese bank MUFG Bank."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/wordpress-is-now-selling-100-year-domains/,TechCrunch,WordPress is now selling 100-year domains,"WordPress, a company that has been around for 20 years, is now selling domains with a 100-year registration length. That means your blog or website will probably live longer than you. The company announced in a blog post that this 100-year plan is ideal for families to preserve their history on the internet and for founders to document their company’s journey. While the promise of keeping digital assets for a century sounds promising, it comes at the cost of a $38,000 one-time payment. In exchange, WordPress will provide a domain with 100-year-long registration, automatic backup to multiple servers and even the Internet Archive, advanced ownership and hosting tools, and round-the-clock support.  WordPress doesn’t mention in its post how it plans to keep domains and backups updated with the ever-changing internet landscape or what happens to the domains if the company decides to shut down the program for some reason. Tech companies such as IBM, AT&T and Siemens have lasted for more than 100 years, but their offerings have changed drastically over time. Modern computing and the internet are a few decades old and it’s uncertain what the future of websites will look like. It will be interesting to see how WordPress evolves this project with the web. “Whether it’s giving a newborn the special gift of a domain and lifetime home on the web, or something you put in your will to make sure your website and story are accessible to future generations, I hope this plan gets people and other companies thinking about building for the long term,” WordPress CEO Matt Mullenweg said in a statement. In the past few months, WordPress has tried to launch new products and features to adapt to the current environment. In March, WordPress-owner Automattic acquired an ActivityPub plug-in to integrate blogs with the Fediverse. In June, the company launched an AI writing assistant to help users with the writing process. At the same time, it launched a paid newsletter product rivaling Substack."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/markato/,TechCrunch,"Lightspeed backs Markato, a marketplace that helps independent brands break into Asia","During the pandemic, almost all retailers in Asia established an e-commerce presence and adopted digital payments. But one thing that didn’t change was sourcing, say the founders of cross-border marketplace Markato. Retailers still need to travel to overseas trade shows, cold e-mail new brands and fulfill orders by filling out forms and purchase orders. Markato wants to change that with a cross-border marketplace focused on independent brands that also lets them manage their Asia wholesale operations in one place. The startup is launching in Hong Kong today with $5 million in seed funding led by Lightspeed, marking the venture firm’s first investment in Hong Kong. Markato was founded this year by Brian Lo and Martin Li, who previously worked at Deliveroo and Uber, respectively. The two told TechCrunch in an email that they believe there is huge potential for the B2B wholesale business model in Asia, the biggest retail market in the world, and were inspired by the success of similar wholesale marketplaces. They wanted to work with independent brands because many lack the time, resources and knowledge to tap into Asia’s retail market. Lo and Li said independent brands usually have to build local teams or work with traditional wholesalers to overcome cultural and language differences when selling in new markets. Just as Uber and Deliveroo digitized the transportation and food industries, Markato is focused on digitizing the process of getting boutique brands to overseas retailers. Some examples of the brands it works with include ceramic brands Jore Copenhagen and Ini Ceramique, natural wellness line Nala Care, candle studios Ambustum and Stan Editions and jewelry brand Gisel B. Markato founders Brian Lo and Martin Li. Image Credits: Markato For retailers, Markato gives personalized product recommendations, which makes it easier for them to discover new brands. Then it enables them to buy at wholesale prices from European, American and Australian brands by aggregating volume. Markato offers a 60-day buy now, pay later option and 90-day free returns, making it less risky for retailers to have unsold inventory and making it more likely for them to try out new products. In turn, brands get analytics that help them make decisions on production and pricing, while reducing their customer acquisition and operating costs. Lo and Li said Markato is able to lower the price of cross-border e-commerce for SMB buyers and sellers by integrating with payment infrastructure that saves on foreign currency and other payment-related transaction costs. It is also able to secure lower cross-border rate costs for marketplace users to reduce shipping, which are further reduced by consolidated shipment volumes. Markato now has 19 employees and has worked with 200 brands. About 80% of the brands it serves were previously not available in Asia, and 90% are sold exclusively through Markato. The platform has more than 4,000 products listed currently, and is planning to grow to 2,000 buyers and 2,000 brands over the next few months. Some of the retailers it currently serves include kapok, Co Ninety Select Shop, TLE Wellness Select Shop and JIA Group. Markato plans to expand across the region soon, starting with Singapore. The funding will be used to hire for its engineering, product and business development teams, and build out proprietary tech, work on its logistics infrastructure and develop its data analytics. In a statement about the funding, Lightspeed partner Rahul Taneja said, “We’re excited to partner with Brian and Martin as they build Markato. Their vision to serve independent businesses in Asia and enable access to the best products globally is a compelling one. Early progress on the platform is very encouraging and we strongly believe they are the perfect team to transform retailers’ end-to-end experience in Asia.”"
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/sec-settles-first-nft-enforcement-case-fines-la-media-company-6m/,TechCrunch,"SEC settles first NFT enforcement case, fines LA media company $6M","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is suing a non-fungible token project, marking the first time the authority has taken enforcement action against a company for selling unregistered NFTs. Impact Theory, a Los Angeles-based media company, “encouraged potential investors to view the purchase of Founder’s Key [the company’s NFT project] as an investment into the business, stating that investors would profit from their purchases if Impact Theory was successful in its efforts,” the SEC order said, adding that the digital assets offered to investors were in the form of “investment contracts” and therefore “securities.” All in all, Impact Theory raised around $30 million from hundreds of investors, including those in the U.S. The case is significant to the crypto industry, which has been hit with a flurry of regulatory clampdowns in the U.S., as it offers a clue for how NFTs could be regulated in the future. Many other NFT projects have used language that’s similar to how Impact Theory marketed its digital assets, that is, touting their blockchain-based identifiers representing digital asset ownership as investment opportunities. Impact Theory neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings but agreed to pay more than $6.1 million in penalties to settle the allegations. The order also established a “Fair Fund” to compensate impacted investors as well as required Impact Theory to destroy all of its Founder’s Key NFTs and eliminate any royalties that it might collect from secondary market transactions. The company is not giving up on its NFT endeavor. In an X post, the founder of Impact Theory stressed that his company will ensure its future digital assets will be of utility rather than financial purposes: “We will operate our go-forward business consistent with our good faith best understanding of all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, will make clear that all of Impact Theory’s digital assets are collectibles with utility within the exciting new landscape of Borderless Entertainment, and will fiercely discourage people from treating our digital assets as anything other than what they are—collectibles with utility. We will have more news on this in the coming weeks and months.”"
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/mfast/,TechCrunch,MFast get backing from Wavemaker Partners to increase financial services access in Vietnam,"The majority of Vietnam’s population live in rural areas and often lack access to financial services because banks and other institutions open most of their physical locations in cities. MFast wants to change that with what it says is the leading financial services distribution network in Vietnam. The company announced today it has raised $6 million in its Series A funding round, led by Wavemaker Partners. The round also got participation from new investors Finnoventure Fund I (managed by Krungsri Finnovate) and Headline Asia, alongside returning backers Do Ventures, JAFCO Asia and Ascend Vietnam Ventures. This brings MFast’s total raised in the six years since its launch to $10 million, including a $1.5 million pre-Series A round TechCrunch covered in June 2021. MFast’s network currently includes 160,000 active agents who work with customers in tier 2 and tier 3 cities throughout Vietnam. It has served more than a million users in Vietnam so far. The company will use its new funding to broaden its operations in Vietnam, with plans to expand outside the country, starting with the Philippines, by next year. MFast helps its customers get access to financial services, including loans and insurance, and high-ticket items like home appliances from brands that don’t usually open retail branches in rural areas. Its agents join MFast to make supplementary income and are provided with an agent app that serves as a “mini-CRM” by MFast. The company was launched in 2017 as a brand of fintech DigiPay by twin brothers Long Phan and Vinh Phan and currently has partnerships with financial institutions like UOB, SHBFinance, TPBank. Long Phan told TechCrunch that he and Vinh were born in a tier 3 city near the Cambodian border and moved to Ho Chi Minh City for their undergraduate degrees. “Having lived in both rural and urban areas, we witnessed firsthand the difficulties people with backgrounds like us face in getting access to formal financial services,” he said. At the same time, they also saw the challenges people in their hometown faced when trying to get a tertiary education and build a career. MFast was created to help agents get their start in financial advisory and consulting work, while enabling consumers to gain access to bank accounts, loans, insurance and other financial products. Agents, who are provided with online training sessions and offline workshops, help end customers open CASA bank accounts, loans, credit cards, insurance or shop for appliances with zero-interest purchase financing options. The company’s new funding will be used for its proprietary technology. Phan said MFast plans to roll out new features like its Agent360 profile portal, credit scoring engine, AI fraud detector and an end-user app. It plans to expand to the Philippines while growing its agent network in Vietnam. Most of MFast’s agents come through referrals, or “agent-get-agent,” alongside MFast’s online acquisition strategies through SEO and performance marketing. Phan says prospective agents can download the MFast app and register in four minutes. MFast competes with companies that work as agents for financial institutions, but Phan said most of them don’t have tech integration or apps. The company differentiates through its agent network and established base of financial institutions, which it continues to grow. It also uses tech to help agents work more effectively by ensuring transparency in every interaction with stakeholders like end users and capturing data such as user demographics, preferences and financial status. That data is enabling MFast to build a credit scoring engine, sales engine and product development strategy that includes creating exclusive products. In a statement about the investment, Wavemaker Partners principal Phuong Tran said, “With its strong agent base and initial focus on financial products, MFast has achieved impressive results. Wavemaker is proud to strengthen our partnership with the company and support it as it enters its next phase of growth.”"

2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/mercedes-to-open-first-charging-hubs-in-atlanta-china-germany/,TechCrunch,"Mercedes to open first charging hubs in Atlanta, China, Germany","Mercedes-Benz has shared plans to open its first electric vehicle DC fast-charging hubs in Atlanta, Georgia; Chengdu, China; and Mannheim, Germany, starting in the fourth quarter of 2023. The automaker plans to install 2,000 charging hubs worldwide by the end of 2024, with 10,000 chargers in North America, Europe, China and “other core markets” by 2030. In July, Mercedes joined the ranks of automakers to adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) charge port. Starting in 2024, the automaker will offer an NACS adapter for any existing EV with CCS ports so that those vehicles can access Tesla’s extensive Supercharging network — 45,000 chargers worldwide, as of April 2023. For model years 2025 and later, Mercedes’s North American vehicles will be built with an NACS port. As Mercedes builds out new hubs, the type of charge point it uses (i.e., CCS, NACS or the Chinese standard GB/T) will depend on the region. The company did not share what ports its new hubs will be built with, but it did say that the “Mercedes-Benz High-Power Charging Network” will be accessible to all brands. Mercedes-Benz customers will get some perks, though, like the ability to reserve a charging point via the Mercedes me Charge service. Following Tesla’s lead, the charging stations will offer features like “Plug * Charge,” which allows customers to automate the charging and payment process as soon as the charging cable is plugged in. The automaker also said its new charging stations will be integrated directly into route planning to show drivers the best way to charge. Mercedes said it will choose charging station locations that are near main traffic areas and select dealerships and that are near amenities like refreshments and restrooms. Some stations will have canopies to protect against weather — a feature that is common at Tesla’s charging hubs as well."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/cruise-is-bringing-its-robotaxis-to-seattle-and-washington-dc/,TechCrunch,"Cruise is bringing its robotaxis to Seattle and Washington, DC","Cruise, the self-driving subsidiary of General Motors, said Monday it has begun manual data collection in Seattle and Washington, DC, the first step toward launching commercial services in the cities. Data collection involves manually driving a robotaxi around to grab information on the local driving environment and climate. The next step will be mapping the new cities. The move to expand operations to two cities on opposite coasts comes as pressure mounts for the robotaxi company in its hometown of San Francisco. Cruise, along with its competitor Alphabet-owned Waymo, secured permits in mid-August from California regulators to expand their commercial, fully driverless robotaxi services across San Francisco 24/7. In the week that followed, Cruise vehicles were involved in a series of incidents, including 10 robotaxis stalling and causing gridlock, a vehicle that drove into wet cement, and a crash with a fire truck that left a passenger injured. As a result, the California Department of Motor Vehicles requested that Cruise immediately reduce its robotaxi fleet by 50% in San Francisco while it conducts an investigation into the company. Despite these issues, Cruise is doggedly moving forward with its expansion plans. The company in 2021 said it plans to have “tens of thousands” of Cruise Origins, Cruise’s yet-to-be-deployed purpose-built AV, on roads in major U.S. cities in the coming years. The U.S. Department of Transportation has still yet to approve “We’re pipelining our deployment playbook across several cities simultaneously now,” tweeted Cruise founder and CEO Kyle Vogt. Seattle is the northernmost city that Cruise has approached. Most autonomous vehicle companies have stuck to testing along the sun belt or in cities with mild weather. Inclement weather like rain or snow can affect the ability of sensors, like lidar, radar and cameras, to accurately perceive the environment and make safe driving decisions. As a rainy city with plenty of hills, Seattle will present a unique challenge for Cruise’s self-driving system. Before the company can begin testing in Seattle, it’ll have to secure a permit from the Seattle Department of Transportation under the agency’s Autonomous Vehicle Testing Permit program. Amazon’s Zoox and Nvidia both hold AV permits from Seattle, which require a human driver in the vehicle to monitor and take over the vehicle as needed. Cruise has not confirmed whether it has already applied for a Seattle AV permit. Nor has the company confirmed its application for a driverless testing permit in Washington, DC. Seattle and DC are two out of 16 total cities in which Cruise is either mapping, testing or deploying its self-driving cars. Cruise’s formula for rollouts typically starts with entering a new market with test vehicles to collect data and map, followed by AV testing with a human driver in the front seat. Eventually, Cruise drops the human driver and tests the vehicles autonomously. A ride-hailing service will then become available first to employees and then to customers who have signed up for the service. The service area and hours of operation usually start on a limited basis, often at night, and slowly expand. Here’s a brief rundown of Cruise’s footprint so far: In August, Cruise began initial testing of its self-driving vehicles in Atlanta. The company didn’t provide many details in its post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, stating only “more to come.” Aside from San Francisco, where Cruise offers a full commercial robotaxi service citywide, the AV company has begun data collection and mapping in Los Angeles and San Diego. Cruise began mapping Dubai in July 2022 in preparation for a planned launch in 2023. The company said it hopes to put Cruise Origins on Dubai’s streets this year. Dubai’s RTA confirmed in April that Cruise has several autonomous Chevy Bolts — at least five can be seen in one video — collecting data and testing in the Jumeirah 1 area, a residential area on the coast. Cruise confirmed that it’s testing robotaxis in a small city in Japan in partnership with Honda. Honda is working with Cruise and GM to produce the Origin. Honda has stated a goal to launch a mobility-as-a-service in Japan using Origins by mid-decade. Vogt said in September at a Goldman Sachs event that Cruise partly chose Japan to test how its autonomous tech does on streets where people drive on the left side of the road. “We do obviously have to adapt to different street signs and other things there,” said Vogt. “In terms of commercialization, we are interested in engaging in a robotaxi business in Japan for sure.” On September 1, Cruise announced that it has begun manual data collection in Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Henderson and more across Clark County, Nevada. Cruise announced in July that it had begun initial testing and data collection in Miami. “Phase 1 is to familiarize our fleet with additional, diverse road conditions while collecting data,” the company said at the time in a tweet. In late July, Cruise announced plans to expand its robotaxi service to Nashville. The company has not shared details as to when it will launch there. Last week, Cruise finished its preliminary testing of driverless cars in Charlotte and began initial tests in Raleigh. Cruise first soft-launched its robotaxi service in Chandler, a city southeast of Phoenix, in December 2022. In early August, the company expanded its radius in the Phoenix area by 20x to include Tempe and Scottsdale. The free service is available from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. for “power users” initially, and then will roll out to members of the general public. At the end of 2022, Cruise began testing its vehicles in Austin. The company currently offers a free driverless service in downtown and central Austin, including the University of Texas campus, from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. The company said in March it would begin testing its Origins in the city within the coming weeks but has not confirmed if it has done so. Cruise also began supervised testing of AVs in Houston and Dallas in May, meaning testing with a human safety driver in the car. The company says it is on track to begin a driverless ride-hail service for members of the public “soon.” This article has was last updated September 7."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/creators-guild-america-influencer-labor-rights-nonprofit/,TechCrunch,A new creator’s guild aims to protect online content creators,"Content creation is work, but in such a rapidly shifting social media landscape, creators face an uphill battle fighting for fair pay and ownership of their content — typically without any institutional support. The Creators Guild of America (CGA) wants to change that.  The CGA, which launched last week, describes itself as a “professional service organization” instead of a labor union. It won’t act as a collective bargaining unit or authorize strikes, but it does offer benefits that are “similar to those offered by unions,” according to its site. The nonprofit group seeks to back creators with the benefits that workers in more traditional professions also enjoy, like providing networking events and working with brands and studios to advocate for fair pay.  The CGA’s board includes Justine Ezarik, known as iJustine, who has been a fixture of YouTube since 2006. Membership isn’t just for influencers; the CGA is open to videographers, designers, photographers and others across the “supply chain of the creator economy.” Its founder Daniel Abas compared the vast swath of occupations within content creation to that of the film industry.  “Much like in film, it takes an entire group of people to bring that piece of art to life,” Abas told The Information. “Only taking a look at one facet of the creator economy does an injustice to all the other creative people that contribute their time and creative talents.”  Membership is $99 per year, and eligibility is specific to the three categories of digital creator that the CGA recognizes. “Media” creators (influencers, online personalities and gamers) qualify if they have at least 15,000 followers and made $15,000 in brand deals within a year. “Marketing” creators (social managers, videographers, designers and photographers) can join if they have active employment at an agency or if they have at least 25,000 followers across five managed accounts. “Makers” (founders, developers and producers) are eligible for membership by raising $500,000 in venture capital or reaching 50,000 streams, downloads or installations.  In addition to access to resources and work opportunities, CGA members will receive accreditation for the work they’ve produced, which will be published in a public database of authenticated member projects. Creating a public record of work, independent of who owns it or where it’s hosted, is vital for creators to establish themselves as industry professionals. Like IMDb, the CGA database will track and validate creators’ contributions to the creator industry. “In every creative profession, your credits are your currency,” the CGA states. “They demonstrate a public record of accomplishment, the foundation on which your reputation rests.”  If creators don’t yet meet the eligibility requirements, the CGA also offers a free “Associate” tier that provides access to the group’s newsletters and certain networking events.  The CGA is the latest attempt to organize creators and establish industry standards, which other organizations have struggled to accomplish. The Internet Creators Guild, an organization founded by beloved YouTuber Hank Green, shut down in 2019 due to lack of funding. SAG-AFTRA opened membership to influencers and content creators in 2021 in a special agreement that covers commercial work and brand deals. The union does not negotiate directly with social media platforms on behalf of members, however. This summer, creators signed the Labor Over Likes pledge, promising to not take work from struck studios in solidarity with the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes.  Another group of organized creators is trying to take on tech platforms themselves. Night Media president Ezra Cooperstein founded the Creator Project because “platforms have too much power” over creators. The initiative is still in its early stages, and organizes meetings in a Discord server of about 400 members. "
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/astras-apollo-fusion-acquisition-followed-by-delays-and-desertion/,TechCrunch,Astra’s Apollo Fusion acquisition followed by delays and desertion,"Two years ago, Astra hailed its acquisition of satellite propulsion startup Apollo Fusion as a strategic move that would round out its launch business and bring expert engineers into the fold. But under Astra leadership, Apollo Fusion quickly disintegrated, with the majority of the original team resigning, leaving few people to staff the one part of the business that had substantial customer demand and the promise of revenue. An August 14, 2023 settlement agreement between Astra and Apollo Fusion holders, LinkedIn data showing an employee exodus, internal company documents, as well as interviews with multiple sources, exposes what will likely become a canonical cautionary tale on aerospace acquisitions. Astra did not respond to TechCrunch’s multiple requests for comment on this story. Astra was flying high in 2021 when it announced its plans to acquire Apollo Fusion. The company was busy iterating its Rocket 3 launch vehicle and in the middle of closing a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that would furnish the combined company with a war chest topping around $500 million. “Becoming a public company is the next milestone in our mission to improve life on Earth from space,” Astra CEO Chris Kemp said in a press release about the merger at the time. “This will scale our business and make space more accessible.” The Apollo acquisition, announced a little more than a month before Astra went public, appeared to be the first step in a plan to vertically integrate its core launch business with space services. When the SPAC was announced, Astra said it was going to develop a “modular spacecraft platform” for its rockets. A few months later, Astra also filed an application with regulators to deploy more than 13,600 broadband satellites, so a spacecraft engine business seemed sensible. In May 2022, the company told investors it would “power the space economy” with its Astra constellation, launched on Astra rockets, in 2023. There has been no subsequent public update regarding this project, and it has launched none thus far. Behind the scenes, the combination of the two companies led to a number of problems. Astra’s internal organization structure — and how Apollo Fusion staff fit into it — was one of the first areas that sowed discontent.  Like many aerospace firms, Astra uses a “matrix” organization chart, where employees report to a traditional manager that’s vertically above them in the org chart, and an additional person, like a product manager who might manage teams across many departments. When implemented well, matrix structures facilitate collaboration across teams working on complex projects. But when speed of execution is paramount, it can often slow decision-making and prevent teams from executing quickly.    One source, who spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity, described how, post-acquisition, none of the Apollo Fusion team members continued to report to Apollo CEO and co-founder Mike Cassidy. Nor did they report to the same few managers; instead, they each reported to someone different within Astra’s organization. It was an “unusual structure,” the source said, “that all of the Apollo Fusion employees were reporting to someone different at Astra.” Decision-making at Astra was also impaired by complex budgeting and approval processes. There would be long debates over decisions like job titles and reporting structures. As a result, sometimes the propulsion team wouldn’t get parts ordered quickly enough, or they were unable to hire people to work on the spacecraft engines, sources said. “It was a very schizophrenic thing where part of management was saying, ‘We have to invest, we have to do great things with Apollo,’ but there was no investment there. [There were] no hires,” the same person said, speaking of the months after the acquisition closed. Internal documents reviewed by TechCrunch appear to support these claims. One document lists a number of roles within the spacecraft engine team, spanning engineering and operations, that would need to be filled in order for Astra to stick to its delivery schedule; sources with firsthand knowledge say these went unfilled for months after the requested start dates. The string of chronic issues bred frustration, ultimately leading to all but two of Apollo Fusion engineers and staff leaving the company, LinkedIn data and interviews with multiple sources show.  These frustrations were clear even to people outside the company, according to another source who dealt with Astra and Apollo Fusion as a customer. They described how it became more challenging to communicate with the Apollo Fusion team post-acquisition, with Astra injecting its own business development people, who knew relatively little about the product, into existing relationships. Apollo Fusion team members started planning their departures, the customer said, referring to what he heard directly from those employees: “People from Apollo Fusion were essentially planning their exits left, right and center, as soon as they were able to do so financially.” A separate source said Astra displayed little interest in retention. “There was no interest in keeping talent,” the source said while describing the spacecraft engine business. “There were a lot of Apollo people that were looking to parachute out and more excited about getting out.”  “It’s important to remember, with Astra, everything is about the rocket,” this source continued. “[The spacecraft engine business] has always been a stepchild. It only became important last fall when they realized that was going to be where the vast majority of their revenue was going to come from.”  As time went on, the in-space propulsion team shrank while the launch side swelled, an issue that was compounded by Apollo Fusion members quitting and not being replaced. The majority of the Apollo Fusion team had cleared out by October 2022, less than 18 months after the acquisition closed. LinkedIn data shows that Astra eventually lost nearly every Apollo Fusion staffer, including the engineers that took the spacecraft engine product from clean sheet to flight heritage. “There were fewer people working on [the spacecraft engine] a year after the acquisition than before the acquisition, because some of the Apollo people either left or they were pulled in to work on [Astra’s satellite project],” the source said. “So there were fewer people even though that business was booming.” The public got its first intimation that there may be issues between the two newly merged companies on August 14, when Astra unexpectedly announced it was entering into a settlement agreement with Apollo Fusion holders “to settle and resolve any and all actual or threatened disputes” over the acquisition. The firm representing Apollo holders in the agreement declined to answer TechCrunch’s questions about the dispute, and there are scant details into the exact nature of the conflict in the filing Astra submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but it appears to be related to performance-based payments entitled to Apollo shareholders following the close of the deal.  Per the terms, Apollo shareholders will likely walk away with $7 million in cash to settle its disputes — a steep drop from the up to $95 million in cash-plus-stock performance-based earnouts the two firms agreed upon back in 2021.    Two years on from the acquisition, the company has been slow to deliver spacecraft engine systems. Astra’s space systems business pulled in $3.4 million in revenue in 2022 and just $700,000 in revenue so far this year (all of that made in the second quarter), according to public statements. Astra says that it has a 278-engine backlog, worth $77 million in revenue; assuming from those figures that each propulsion costs around $250,000, that would total around 16 deliveries to date.  To solve this problem, Astra recently announced that it would make a “strategic reallocation of its workforce,” reassigning 50 workers from its launch division to work on spacecraft engines. With this additional talent, Astra said “a substantial majority” of these orders are expected to be delivered by the end of 2024. However, internal documents viewed by TechCrunch show that Astra provided customers with much more ambitious timelines. In the fall of 2022, the company said it was aiming to deliver 42 propulsion systems each to Airbus and another customer by the end of 2023. In a separate document, Astra assured Earth observation firm Maxar that it would have delivered around 80 propulsion systems for other customers by August 2023. Astra told a separate customer it would put 125 systems in space this year. It’s possible that supplier issues or problems with customers’ internal timelines contributed to the late schedules, but regardless of contributing factors, it’s worth noting just how delayed the programs are: Astra anticipates delivering just eight to 12 propulsion systems by the end of the third quarter of this year, according to its most recent financial guidance.  In contrast, other electric propulsion providers have made significant strides. Electric thruster developer Busek now has more than 100 systems operating on-orbit for OneWeb; ExoTerra Resource gained flight heritage just this month for its Halo Hall-effect thrusters.  Astra seems determined to catch up, but they face a number of headwinds, including a delisting notice from Nasdaq (which was extended for six months in April) and a rapidly dwindling cash reserve. The company said it had $26.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the second quarter this year.  The company is currently “actively focused” on finding investors for its launch and spacecraft engine businesses, Kemp told the media earlier this week. "
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/uber-eats-developing-ai-chatbot-offer-recommendations-speed-up-ordering/,TechCrunch,"Uber Eats is reportedly developing an AI chatbot that will offer recommendations, speed up ordering","Uber Eats is developing an AI-powered chatbot that will offer recommendations to users and offer them a quicker way to place orders, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The report says developer Steve Moser discovered details about the chatbot inside of code hidden within the Uber Eats app. The chatbot will ask users about their budget, food preferences and then help them place an order. It’s unknown when Uber plans to launch the chatbot publicly. Uber did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. The report comes as Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi recently told Bloomberg Television that the company was developing an AI chatbot, but did not share specific details about it. Khosrowshahi did note that Uber already uses AI to match customers to drivers and couriers. With this upcoming offering, Uber joins other delivery apps that are also looking to incorporate AI into their platforms and services. Earlier today, DoorDash announced that it’s launching AI-powered voice ordering technology that will allow restaurants to increase their sales by answering all of the calls they receive. Plus, the company is working on an AI-powered chatbot to speed up ordering and help customers find food options. A few months ago, Instacart launched an AI search tool powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The new “Ask Instacart” search tool is designed to help customers save time and assist them with shopping questions by offering personalized recommendations. Ever since OpenAI’s ChatGPT took over the internet, tech companies have been incorporating AI-powered features into their products to bring more of the technology into consumers’ hands. As a result, it makes sense for delivery apps to do the same. Some users may find a chatbot that’s able to take their budget and preferences into account a welcome addition to their food delivery app."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/survey-finds-relatively-few-americans-actually-use-or-fear-chatgpt/,TechCrunch,Survey finds relatively few Americans actually use (or fear) ChatGPT,"From its prominence in the tech world, you might think that everyone on the planet is using ChatGPT or some other AI tool for everything from automating their job to planning their garden. But recent Pew polling suggests the language model isn’t quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it. Of course that changes by demographic: Men, those 18-29 and the college educated are more likely to have used the system, though even among those groups it’s 30-40%. (You can see further breakdowns of this in the chart below.) It’s still a remarkably fast ascent for a technology that was all but unheard of a year ago. You don’t generally get two thirds of America hearing about something like hypervisors or a new model of phone in that stretch of time. More people reported using it for “entertainment” or “to learn something” than for work, which tracks with the anecdotal evidence of people trying the chatbot out now and then or using it casually to sum up some unfamiliar field. “What’s the Higgs boson” or “Tell me a fairy tale about Timothée Chalamet” is more common than “Write a Python script to extract title and abstract from a given database of neuroscience papers.” Image Credits: Pew Research Center That said, among those who have heard of ChatGPT said it is likely to have a major impact on software engineers, graphic designers and journalists; we may safely speculate that there is some conflation of other generative and interpretive AI models in there, and the sense is that AI in general, not necessarily ChatGPT specifically, will lead to this impact. Overall, though, only 19% of employed people who’d heard of the model thought it would affect their job in a major way, and 27% expect no impact whatsoever. Interestingly, even fewer people (15%) thought it would be helpful. But people in the “information and technology” sector especially, along with those in education and finance, are much more likely to expect major or minor changes. Few in hospitality, entertainment and hands-on industries like construction and manufacturing reported feeling that way. In a separate and slightly more recent polling analysis, Pew researchers found that people are much more concerned in general about the role of AI in everyday life: 47%, up from 31% last year, said AI makes them “more concerned than excited.” And the more they know (or think they know) about AI, the more concerned they are. This all tracks with the general sense about AI that we have seen in the popular discourse: That we don’t know quite what is going to happen, and that makes us uneasy. It could be helpful, it could be invasive, it could require regulation, it might just totally pass your industry by. But it’s likely that in another year from now, an even greater majority will have heard of ChatGPT and its cousins — and they’ll probably have stronger opinions about it too."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/connections-is-the-new-york-times-most-played-game-after-wordle/,TechCrunch,Connections is The New York Times’ most played game after Wordle,"The gamers behind the Gray Lady have a new game to add into our morning rotations: Connections, which invites the player to categorize 16 words or phrases into four distinct groups of four. The daily puzzle game debuted in beta on June 12, and according to The New York Times, it’s now the paper’s second most popular game — of course, Wordle holds the top spot. This is an impressive feat for the game, since until today, it was only playable on web browsers. But now, the game will be integrated into The New York Times and New York Times Games apps on iOS and Android, bringing in even more players. “Each day reveals a clever, thoughtful, relevant, human-made puzzle that tries to trick you, and makes the challenge of solving it extremely rewarding,” said New York Times head of games Jonathan Knight (isn’t it wild that he has to clarify the game is made by humans?). The Times also said that about nine out of 10 people who play the game will see it through until the end, whether they win or lose; per Knight’s prepared statements, the game has “millions” of players, and is the most popular in-house game launch since the Mini, a bite-sized crossword. Earlier this month, the Times sunsetted its math game Digits, which was also in beta. With the integration into The New York Times’ apps, Connections fans can rest easy knowing that the game is here to stay. The New York Times’ gaming section has been booming since its acquisition of Wordle last year. Just a few months after buying Wordle, The New York Times said that the game had brought in tens of millions of new users. Connections isn’t quite the once-in-a-blue-moon viral phenomenon that was Wordle, but if you like wordplay, it’s pretty darn fun."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/amazon-increases-its-free-shipping-minimum-to-35-for-non-prime-members-in-some-regions/,TechCrunch,Amazon increases its free shipping minimum to $35 for non-Prime members in some regions,"Amazon is increasing its free shipping minimum to $35 for customers who don’t have a Prime membership in some regions, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Monday. Up until now, the free shipping minimum was $25. Amazon says it’s testing the new free shipping threshold randomly by ZIP code-grouped regions and that everyone in the same region will see the same free shipping threshold. The news was first reported by CNBC. “We continually evaluate our offerings and make adjustments based on those assessments,” an Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email. “We’re currently testing a $35 minimum for non-Prime customers to qualify for free shipping. Prime members continue to enjoy free delivery on over 300 million items, with tens of millions of items available for free Same or One-Day Delivery.” The company is looking to push more customers toward it Prime offering with this new change. The change does not impact Prime members, who pay $139 annually or $15 per month for free shipping and other membership perks. It’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time that Amazon has changed its free shipping threshold, as it increased the minimum to $49 from $35 back in 2016, and then brought it back to $35 in 2017. The company later dropped the price point to $25 to undercut Walmart, which has a $35 free shipping minimum for customers who aren’t subscribed to Walmart+. The new change brings Amazon in-line with Walmart’s offering. By increasing the free shipping threshold, it seems that the company is attempting to cut costs, which is something Amazon has been looking to do across its business. Amazon cut 27,000 jobs this year and froze corporate hiring. The company also started charging delivery fees for Fresh grocery orders that are less than $150, removing a perk that gave Prime members free delivery on orders over $35. In addition, Amazon ended AmazonSmile, which was a donation program that redirects 0.5% of the cost of all eligible products toward charities."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/friend-tech-daily-transactions-drop/,TechCrunch,Friend.tech gets unfriended: Daily transactions drop 95% as hyped decentralized social app loses steam,"It may be time to put to rest yet another effort to build a social network on a blockchain: The number of transactions on decentralized social network friend.tech has cratered after less than 20 days since its launch. Friend.tech is trying a new spin on a decentralized social network by letting users tokenize themselves and sell “shares,” now dubbed “keys,” to fans and followers. People who buy these shares then become “shareholders” and can engage with the creator directly. While many rushed to sign up like it was the next gold mine as big name crypto influencers, NBA players and OnlyFans creators jumped onto the platform, others were more cautious and skeptical because the app needed you to deposit funds when signing up, lacked a clear privacy policy, and had a pretty foggy roadmap. Now it appears the people who hesitated on betting their net worth on others’ may be the ones to come out on top. Activity on the app, running as an invite-only public beta since August 10, declined 95% from a peak of almost 39,000 daily transactions on August 21 to about 1,400 at the time of writing, according to Dune Analytics data from user cryptokoryo. Just seven days ago, I wondered if friend.tech’s early growth would be sustainable, and we can see that the answer is clearly no. Besides declining transactions, the inflow of funds on the protocol has also tumbled from $1.98 million at its peak on August 20 to about $8,300 today. Still, the app has recorded inflow of about $81 million in total, which isn’t insignificant for a platform this new. To be fair, it isn’t uncommon to see declining user engagement after launch: Social media platforms Bluesky and Threads gained ample early traction only to see the hubbub fade in the following weeks and months.

2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/angry-miaos-am-afa-r2-is-part-sculpture-part-keyboard/,TechCrunch,"Angry Miao’s AM AFA R2 is part sculpture, part keyboard","Whether you love their keyboards or not, there can be no doubt that Angry Miao doesn’t do things halfway. The AM 65 Less is an exercise in building a high-quality 65% keyboard that replaced the cursor keys with a touch panel. The AM Hatsu looks like it was imported from the future, while the Cyberboard would almost be a conventional keyboard if it wasn’t for its massive LED panel. With the AM AFA, the company introduced its version of an Alice-style ergonomic layout last year and now it’s back with a second run of this anime-inspired mechanical keyboard. As always, it’s almost impossible to find fault with Angry Miao’s build quality. This is a solid board, weighing in at just under five pounds (or 2.26 kilos) and like the AM Hatsu, it’ll ship in Angry Miao’s signature suitcase-style case. The design, with the wide-open pattern at the front and back, makes it seem almost weightless and like it floats on your desktop, though — especially as you sit in front of it. It’s a smart design trick and exactly what you would expect from Angry Miao. In addition to the sculpture-like metal frame, the actual keyboard actually consists of three interconnected parts that help to create this illusion. The two halves of the keyboard are actually separate pieces of hardware, with the control module (which now features a cover made from real glass compared to the plastic cover of the first version) in the middle. They are connected through very thin ribbon cables that you never really see in day-to-day use, making the design feel even more open. The company says it takes roughly 10 hours of CNC processing and manual polishing to create the metal structure. Image Credits: TechCrunch Let’s just get the prices out of the way, because this is not a budget keyboard: The base kit without switches and keycaps will retail for $680 and the full bundle goes for $795. That’s a lot, but not out of the ordinary for a high-end mechanical keyboard (and the AM Hatsu cost is closer to $1,600). In the U.S., it’ll be available as a group buy through Space Cables, starting at 8 pm PT on August 31. Image Credits: Angry Miao For the most part, the AM AFA is a standard hot-swap Alice-style board, with the usual slightly curved and angled split layout and 68 keys. But this is Angry Miao, so you’ll quickly find some quirks as well. The distance between the two halves is significantly larger than that on a standard Alice layout, at 64.5 millimeters. To me, that makes for a more comfortable typing position. The company also decided to put the right shift button to the right of the up arrow, for example. If you often use right shift, that’s going to take some getting used to. It made me realize I’m 100% a left shift user, so it never bothered me, but your mileage may vary. Another twist here is that the team put the page up, down and delete keys on the left side of the keyboard, inverting what most users would expect. Because that doesn’t affect any of my day-to-day typing, I didn’t mind that change and got used to it fairly quickly. Image Credits: TechCrunch With this second run of the keyboard, the company is introducing five new designs. The version the company sent me was the gold and green “Magic Forest” edition, inspired by Nintendo’s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. There’s also a slightly tuned version of the first version of the AM AFA, the Macross-inspired VF-19, Pink Slayer, Cyber Cop and Unit-01. The Magic Forest colors are definitely striking, even as I admit that I personally wouldn’t necessarily have chosen it. If you don’t quite like the choice of top plate, there’s another nice feature here: Those top plates are magnetic and very easy to replace. Angry Miao will include four alternative plates with the retail version. Image Credits: Angry Miao Like with the first version, Angry Miao uses its three-stage adjustable leaf spring mount to allow users to adjust the bounce of the keyboard. With the first edition, changing those springs was rather arduous. You had to remove a total of 24 screws and pretty much completely disassemble the entire keyboard. That didn’t exactly invite a lot of experimentation. With this new version, you only have to remove the magnetic top plate, remove eight screws and remove the ribbon cables from both sides and you have full access to the springs. That’s because now the PCB assembly sits inside what’s essentially a tray, making it very easy to take apart. Out of the box — or in this case, the suitcase — you get all of the tools you need to make these changes. I think the spring leaves are one of Angry Miao’s best innovations. I prefer a slightly bouncy keyboard and the default option works quite well for me. Now that it’s easy enough to change them, though, I think most buyers will experiment with different options, and adding and removing springs (there are stainless steel and copper ones) actually makes an appreciable difference to how the board feels. Also included in the box are bottom and adjustment pads that slightly change the sound of the board but don’t make too much of a difference for the actual typing feel. Image Credits: TechCrunch Talking about typing feel, the AM AFA bundle comes with Angry Miao’s linear Icy Silver switches. I’ve never had any complaints about those in the company’s other keyboards and they remain a solid option. There’s no scratch and very little wobble. With an initial force of 45g, they sit right in my personal sweet spot. Since this is a hot-swap board, though, you can easily change them out for another type of switch — even a clicky one. I won’t judge you. I don’t love the transparent Glacier Dark keycaps quite as much. They are frosted inside, which makes for a really nice light show from the PCB board’s LEDs, but they are a bit too glossy and smooth for my liking. Unlike many of the cheaper transparent keycaps you can find on Amazon and elsewhere, they do feel rather premium, though — and also enhance the keyboard’s overall sound. I would’ve preferred the excellent triple-shot keycaps Angry Miao used for the AM 65 Less, but that’s purely a personal preference. Image Credits: Angry Miao Personally, I really like the overall sound profile of the AM AFA. It’s not too loud, but you’ll know when you press a key. The sound resembles that of two pool balls colliding, which is close to my personal ideal. Using a different bottom foam and changing out the switches and keycaps allows you to tune this to your heart’s desire. Unlike with most keyboards, I was perfectly happy with the default here, though. Also included in the bundle, by the way, are Angry Miao’s Hover wrist rests. I found the keyboard low enough to type on it without a wrist wrest, but the twist here is that we’re talking about two individual round wrist rests. In good Angry Miao tradition, they can flexibly take on any angle, with opposing magnets in the middle providing some additional cushioning and support. It’s a nifty trick, though I don’t think it’s a must-have. I found myself using a cheap wooden wrist rest I bought for a Keychron Q8 and while it wasn’t a perfect fit, it was a better solution for my typing style. I always wish Angry Miao would support QMK/VIA for customizing its keyboards’ layout and lighting setup. The company’s own software is passable, though I always feel like it’s a bit of an afterthought. I don’t spend a lot of time modifying my layout, so it’s not a dealbreaker for me, but you’d be right to expect a bit more. As with all of these high-end keyboards, whether they are worth their price for you is a personal decision. If I were in the market for a $750 board, though, I think the AM AFA is definitely worth a look. For most people, a Keychron Q8 or Q10 (either in their Pro or standard versions) are perfectly good Alice-style boards for far less (at $210 for a Q8 Pro, for example). The AM AFA is unabashedly a luxury board but it has the build quality and design to back that up."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/free-dating-app-cosmic-uses-personality-quizzes-to-make-a-profile-for-you/,TechCrunch,Free dating app Cosmic uses personality quizzes to make a profile for you,"A new dating app called Cosmic wants to shake up the market by not charging for basic features like seeing who likes you or undoing your last swipe, while also making it easier for users to build profiles that better reflect their personalities using a combination of personality quizzes and machine learning technology. Now available to the public, Cosmic is the first product to debut from the startup Friendly Apps, founded by longtime engineer and product designer Michael Sayman and backed by $3 million in seed funding. The developer has been building apps since he was young — an experience he documented in his book, “App Kid” — which helped him land roles at Facebook, Google, Roblox and, most recently, Twitter, pre–Elon Musk’s acquisition. At Twitter, Sayman was going to focus on building product experiences for teens, but those efforts slowed down after the takeover, giving him the push he needed to go out on his own. The idea behind his new company is to create a suite of apps with a different set of values that are targeted toward helping people achieve their goals without being toxic to users’ health, as many modern-day social apps have become. To start, Sayman has decided to tackle the world of online dating — a market he believes users have grown increasingly frustrated by. Today’s dating apps may be easy to use in terms of their user interface, Sayman explains, but they’re hard to use in terms of actually helping you find what you’re looking for. Image Credits: Friendly Apps “A lot of times I’ll go on dates with people that end up not really being the type of person I thought they were because of the lack of depth that a lot of [dating app] profiles are able to offer,” the founder explains. “Also, I think, just due to the nature of how these apps work, I don’t see a lot of us, including myself, sharing a whole lot of our personality — or the way that we are — on the app. We put a bunch of pictures up and a public bio and that’s kind of it,” he says. Cosmic aims to do things differently. Instead of having users create their bio, it presents you with a personality quiz that asks you just a few questions about yourself — like “What do you like to do for fun?” “What’s most important to you in life?” or “What are your dreams for the future?” These answers are private to the end user — they’re not published on your profile. When complete, the app uses your answers to create a profile for you with the help of machine learning (ML) technology. Image Credits: Friendly Apps Sayman says he came up with this idea because he felt that a lot of people, himself included, aren’t great at describing themselves in bios. He says that his bio either ends up missing aspects of his personality because he doesn’t know which parts to include or which to skip. He realized that a different way of creating bios could work better, where users wrote open-ended answers to a personality quiz, which ML technology could then use to generate your entire profile for you. To work, Cosmic extracts personality traits out of the words that you use in the quiz, including the interests that you have, as well as fun stuff — like what popular song describes your life, the key to your heart, or your greatest strength. Image Credits: Friendly Apps “The cool part about it is it actually tells you a lot more about somebody than I think a lot of us are able to write out ourselves,” Sayman says. The Q&A-powered dating app differs from something like eHarmony, which also relies on quizzes because Cosmic is not comparing your results to someone else’s in order to make a match. Instead, it’s using the answers you provide to create your profile and fill in Hinge-like prompts for you. Sayman coded and designed the app himself without a team, and leveraged a combination of both open source and proprietary technology under the hood. However, he stresses that AI is not actually writing out a full bio for you, as some other apps promise to do. That’s something he thinks feels fake. “They don’t work. It’s frankly, I think, a little bit dishonest,” he says of AI-generated bios. Instead, Cosmic relies on answers to prompts and tags that describe your personality, like “creative,” “tech-savvy,” “ambitious,” “family-oriented,” and so on. The personality quiz and AI aspects aren’t the only differentiators for Cosmic’s dating app. The app also doesn’t charge for things like undoing mistaken swipes or seeing who likes you. “There’s no boost. There’s no subscriptions. There’s no ads. There’s none of that stuff,” Sayman says. There are, however, standard features like photo uploads, blocking and reporting, and various spam prevention tools. Image Credits: Friendly Apps So how will the app monetize? we wondered. That’s a question the founder plans to figure out later on — after he determines if this model even works. The app is available today in the U.S., Peru (where Sayman’s parents are from), Colombia, and a few other countries in South America and Europe. Prior to launch, it has been tested only with a couple hundred beta users."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/subletting-app-kiki-raises-6m-by-using-dating-app-concepts-to-match-listings-and-renters/,TechCrunch,Subletting app Kiki raises $6M by using dating app concepts to match listings and renters,"Kiki (formerly EasyRent), a subletting startup that matches listers with people looking to rent for up to six months, recently closed a $6 million seed round, its co-founder Toby Thomas-Smith exclusively told TechCrunch. The funding will go toward Kiki’s upcoming relaunch in New York City this fall. Blackbird Ventures led the round with $4.5 million, making it the second biggest seed check the VC firm has written. Kiki’s seed round also attracted various notable backers across the tech industry, including former Airbnb exec Harry Uffindell, Facebook Marketplace founder Bowen Pan, former Bumble exec Michelle Battersby, former Canva exec and founder of Phase One Ventures Mahesh Muralidhar, as well as ex-Uber execs Tyler Trerotola and Jaikumar Ganesh, among others. “Kiki’s broader vision of building the world’s biggest ‘community-led marketplace’ is pretty special,” Pan said via an email to TechCrunch, adding that he had seen “a strong need” for a service like this while building Facebook Marketplace, which launched a section for apartment rentals in 2017. “I’m proud to make [Thomas-Smith] and his team my first personal angel investment.” When more investment landlords are buying empty apartments to rent out on services like Airbnb, Kiki is aimed at everyday people that aren’t looking to make a profit. Instead, the app targets users who travel for months at a time and don’t want to lose money on rent while they’re away. “We’re not taking away housing,” Thomas-Smith told us. “We’re using empty space that’s literally already there… we’re bringing money back to the locals.” Image Credits: Kiki Kiki works similarly to dating apps since it matches listers with renters with similar likes and preferences. While this may seem unusual for a subletting service, Kiki wants to help listers — especially first-timers — feel comfortable letting a stranger stay in their home. The app follows an invite-only “friend of friends” model to ensure people are vouched for and will hopefully respect someone else’s space. Users must link their Instagram accounts to be accepted. Thomas-Smith said there is a strict “no weirdos” policy, meaning users need to have at least a few Instagram followers and selfies to join. (Instagram is also where renter and lister communicate because Kiki doesn’t have a direct-messaging feature). “[Kiki] is centered around people over property,” Thomas-Smith added. “It’s all about human psychology. How can someone go from being a stranger to a friend of a friend as quickly as possible?” Kiki has the same profile format as Hinge, with a list of prompts that renters can choose from. For instance, “How would your friends describe you in one sentence?” “I go crazy for” and “This year, I really want to.” Listers are able to set criteria for their listing, such as minimum age or no smokers. Kiki also has a management feature where users can keep track of on-time payments, secure deposit holdings and e-sign sublet agreements. For each listing, Kiki takes 10% of the rent price. Image Credits: Kiki Thomas-Smith founded the company in 2018 while attending university in New Zealand and working for Airbnb. “I was working for Airbnb cleaning toilets and discovered this whole short-term rental market,” Thomas-Smith said. “I learned that these properties were making all their profit over the summer, and then they would lose money over the winter. [I was] like, ‘How are these places sitting empty for almost half a year?’ It seemed crazy to me.” He also discovered that all his college friends renting places for the school year were wasting money when they went home for breaks. To solve this problem, Thomas-Smith built an invite-only matchmaking service — originally called EasyRent — that allowed New Zealand-based students to rent out their places during the summer, mainly to other students coming into town for internships. In 2021, when EasyRent gained enough traction, Thomas-Smith brought on Jack Montgomerie as co-founder and software engineer Alexander Nicholson to help expand its user base to a wider audience. The startup closed a $230,000 (NZD) seed round in 2022 and launched in Sydney, Australia, to users in Bondi Beach. EasyRent filled 1,500 homes just in that one neighborhood alone. Image Credits: Kiki Recently, the company has decided to sunset the app in New Zealand and Australia and focus its efforts on its NYC launch. This October, Kiki is rolling out to one neighborhood to start — either East Village or Williamsburg. Interestingly enough, it will also only be available to Australians at launch. The company saw the most demand from Aussies, particularly those who moved to NYC and want to save on rent when they visit family abroad. Users interested in signing up for the waitlist must submit their selfies along with their Instagram accounts. Kiki is accepting the top 10 people every week based on how many friends they invite and how many people share their Instagram story with @kikiclub.nyc tagged. In the coming weeks, Kiki plans to gradually roll out to different neighborhoods and nationalities. It will be available to everyone in NYC in a few months. Note that subletting an apartment in New York requires the landlord’s permission. If a tenant sublets without approval, the landlord may take legal action against them. A sublease in NYC must last for a minimum of 30 days. Thomas-Smith said Kiki wants to expand to the top 10 cities in the U.S., including Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Seattle and Austin. With investors already lined up for a future Series A funding round, the startup also ambitiously plans to grow its team to 100 employees and launch in 20 cities in Europe by 2024."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/we-dont-have-to-reinvent-the-wheel-to-regulate-ai-responsibly/,TechCrunch,We don’t have to reinvent the wheel to regulate AI responsibly,"We are living through one of the most transformative tech revolutions of the past century. For the first time since the tech boom of the 2000s (or even since the Industrial Revolution), our essential societal functions are being disrupted by tools deemed innovative by some and unsettling to others. While the perceived benefits will continue to polarize public opinion, there is little debate about AI’s widespread impact across the future of work and communication. Institutional investors tend to agree. In the past three years alone, venture capital investment into generative AI has increased by 425%, reaching up to $4.5 billion in 2022, according to PitchBook. This recent funding craze is primarily driven by widespread technological convergence across different industries. Consulting behemoths like KPMG and Accenture are investing billions into generative AI to bolster their client services. Airlines are utilizing new AI models to optimize their route offerings. Even biotechnology firms now use generative AI to improve antibody therapies for life-threatening diseases. Naturally, this disruptive technology has sailed onto the regulatory radar, and fast. Figures like Lina Khan of the Federal Trade Commission have argued that AI poses serious societal risks across verticals, citing increased fraud incidence, automated discrimination, and collusive price inflation if left unchecked. Perhaps the most widely discussed example of AI’s regulatory spotlight is Sam Altman’s recent testimony before Congress, where he argued that “regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models.” As the CEO of one of the world’s largest AI startups, Altman has quickly engaged with lawmakers to ensure that the regulation question evolves into a discussion between the public and private sectors. He’s since joined other industry leaders in penning a joint open letter claiming that “[m]itigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war.”

			Naturally, this disruptive technology has sailed onto the regulatory radar, and fast.

 Technologists like Altman and regulators like Khan agree that regulation is critical to ensuring safer technological applications, but neither party tends to settle on scope. Generally, founders and entrepreneurs seek limited restrictions to provide an economic environment conducive to innovation, while government officials strive for more widespread limits to protect consumers. However, both sides fail to realize that in some areas regulation has been a smooth sail for years. The advent of the internet, search engines, and social media ushered in a wave of government oversight like the Telecommunications Act, The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Rather than institute a broad-stroke, blanket framework of restrictive policies that arguably hinder tech innovation, the U.S. maintains a patchwork of policies that incorporate long-standing fundamental laws like intellectual property, privacy, contract, harassment, cybercrime, data protection, and cybersecurity. These frameworks often draw inspiration from established and well-accepted technological standards and promote their adoption and use in services and nascent technologies. They also ensure the existence of trusted organizations that apply these standards on an operational level. Take the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, for example. At their core, SSL/TLS are encryption protocols that ensure that data transferred between browsers and servers remains secure (enabling compliance with the encryption mandates in CCPA, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, etc.). This applies to customer information, credit card details, and all forms of personal data that malicious actors can exploit. SSL certificates are issued by certificate authorities (CAs), which serve as validators to prove that the information being transferred is genuine and secure. The same symbiotic relationship can and should exist for AI. Following aggressive licensing standards from government entities will bring the industry to a halt and only benefit the most widely used players like OpenAI, Google, and Meta, creating an anticompetitive environment. A lightweight and easy-to-use SSL-like certification standard governed by independent CAs would protect consumer interests while still leaving room for innovation. These could be made to keep AI usage transparent to consumers and make clear whether a model is being operated, what foundational model is at play, and whether it has originated from a trusted source. In such a scenario, the government still has a role to play by co-creating and promoting such protocols to render them widely used and accepted standards. At a foundational level, regulation is in place to protect basic fundamentals like consumer privacy, data security, and intellectual property, not to curb technology that users choose to engage with daily. These fundamentals are already being protected on the internet and can be protected with AI using similar structures. Since the advent of the internet, regulation has successfully maintained a middle ground of consumer protection and incentivized innovation, and government actors shouldn’t take a different approach simply because of rapid technological development. Regulating AI shouldn’t be reinventing the wheel, regardless of polarized political discourse."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/klaviyo-could-break-the-unicorn-ipo-logjam/,TechCrunch,Klaviyo could break the unicorn IPO logjam,"Last Friday, two venture-backed companies filed to go public. Grocery delivery service Instacart dropped its Form S-1 filing along with Klaviyo, a marketing software company from Boston. We dug into Instacart’s filing on Friday but didn’t have time to also spelunk into Klaviyo’s IPO filing. We’re going to do that today, because Klaviyo’s IPO moment perhaps matters more than it would in another time. Here’s an inside look at Klaviyo’s origins, how it’s grown over the years, the trade-offs it made, how email marketing is evolving, and more: The Klaviyo EC-1 Sure, Klaviyo has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and was last valued at nearly $10 billion, but what this IPO does for other companies could prove more important than the money it raises for Klaviyo itself. The American IPO market has been moribund and generally stuck in a quagmire for about 18 months now. Declining tech valuations on the stock market and changing investor sentiment put IPOs on hold. Meanwhile, the venture market contracted, especially the late-stage venture market, squeezing unicorns and leaving their investors unable to cash out.  To get things rolling again, everyone’s been saying that tech companies need a winning IPO to be inspired by. But given the significant uncertainty in the market, no one wanted to take the first step. A champion was needed. A company with enough strength and fortitude to be the first to go public and pave the way so other companies could follow. Instacart fit the bill only partially since it’s more of a delivery company than a pure-play software business. Klaviyo, however, is a shockingly efficient software business that is profitable and growing quickly. This company could be the torch bearer tech startups have been waiting for. Let’s dig into its IPO filing this morning to figure out how it’s grown."
2023-08-28,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/28/openai-launches-a-chatgpt-plan-for-enterprise-customers/,TechCrunch,OpenAI launches a ChatGPT plan for enterprise customers,"Seeking to capitalize on ChatGPT’s viral success, OpenAI today announced the launch of ChatGPT Enterprise, a business-focused edition of the company’s AI-powered chatbot app. ChatGPT Enterprise, which OpenAI first teased in a blog post earlier this year, can perform the same tasks as ChatGPT, such as writing emails, drafting essays and debugging computer code. But the new offering also adds “enterprise-grade” privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options. That puts ChatGPT Enterprise on par, feature-wise, with Bing Chat Enterprise, Microsoft’s recently launched take on an enterprise-oriented chatbot service. “Today marks another step towards an AI assistant for work that helps with any task, protects your company data and is customized for your organization,” OpenAI writes in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. “Businesses interested in ChatGPT Enterprise should get in contact with us. While we aren’t disclosing pricing, it’ll be dependent on each company’s usage and use cases.” ChatGPT Enterprise provides a new admin console with tools to manage how employees within an organization use ChatGPT, including integrations for single sign-on, domain verification and a dashboard with usage statistics. Shareable conversation templates allow employees to build internal workflows leveraging ChatGPT, while credits to OpenAI’s API platform let companies create fully custom ChatGPT-powered solutions if they choose. ChatGPT Enterprise, in addition, comes with unlimited access to Advanced Data Analysis, the ChatGPT feature formerly known as Code Interpreter, which allows ChatGPT to analyze data, create charts, solve math problems and more, including from uploaded files. For example, given a prompt like “Tell me what’s interesting about this data,” ChatGPT’s Advanced Data Analysis capability can look through the data — financial, health or location information, for example — to generate insights. Advanced Data Analysis was previously available only to subscribers to ChatGPT Plus, the $20-per-month premium tier of the consumer ChatGPT web and mobile apps. To be clear, ChatGPT Plus is sticking around — OpenAI sees ChatGPT Enterprise as complementary to it, the company says. ChatGPT Enterprise is powered by GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship AI model, as is ChatGPT Plus. But ChatGPT Enterprise customers get priority access to GPT-4, delivering performance that’s twice as fast as the standard GPT-4 and with an expanded 32,000-token (~25,000-word) context window. Context window refers to the text the model considers before generating additional text, while tokens represent raw text (e.g. the word “fantastic” would be split into the tokens “fan,” “tas” and “tic”). Generally speaking, models with large context windows are less likely to “forget” the content of recent conversations. OpenAI — no doubt attempting to allay the fears of businesses that have restricted their employees from using the consumer version of ChatGPT — emphasizes that it won’t train models on business data sent to ChatGPT Enterprise or any usage data and that all conversations with ChatGPT Enterprise are encrypted in transit and at rest. “We believe AI can assist and elevate every aspect of our working lives and make teams more creative and productive,” writes OpenAI in the blog post. OpenAI claims that there’s acute interest from businesses in an enterprise-focused ChatGPT, claiming that ChatGPT, one of the fastest-growing consumer apps in history, has been adopted by teams in more than 80% of Fortune 500 companies.  But it’s not clear that ChatGPT has staying power.  According to analytics company Similarweb, ChatGPT traffic dropped 9.7% globally from May to June, while average time spent on the web app went down by 8.5%. The dip could be due to the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT app for iOS and Android — and summer vacation (i.e. fewer kids turning to ChatGPT for homework help). But it wouldn’t be surprising if increased competition was playing a part.  OpenAI’s under pressure to monetize the tool regardless. The company reportedly spent upward of $540 million last year to develop ChatGPT, including funds it used to poach talent from the likes of Google, according to The Information. And according to some estimates, ChatGPT is costing OpenAI $700,000 a day to run. Yet OpenAI made only $30 million in revenue in fiscal year 2022. CEO Sam Altman has reportedly told investors that the company intends to boost that figure to $200 million this year and $1 billion next year, and he’s presumably figuring ChatGPT Enterprise into those plans. OpenAI says that its future plans for ChatGPT Enterprise include a ChatGPT Business offering for smaller teams, allowing companies to connect apps to ChatGPT Enterprise, “more powerful” and “enterprise-grade” versions of Advanced Data Analysis and web browsing, and tools designed for data analysts, marketers and customer support. “We look forward to sharing an even more detailed roadmap with prospective customers and continuing to evolve ChatGPT Enterprise based on your feedback,” OpenAI writes."
2023-08-27,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/27/after-threads-bluesky-also-adds-a-way-to-see-your-own-likes/,TechCrunch,"After Threads, Bluesky also adds a way to see your own likes","Bluesky introduced a bunch of updates on Friday to its mobile apps and website, including a new tab to see your own likes, notification support for apps and an emoji picker for the web composer. Earlier this month, Bluesky’s rival Threads added a new tab in settings, called “Your Likes,” to let users look at their own liked posts. In contrast, Bluesky has added a “Likes” tab to users’ profiles. The placement of the tab is similar to X (formerly Twitter), but unlike the Elon Musk-owned social network, Bluesky doesn’t let you see liked posts of other people. Bluesky has added a new likes tab. Image Credits: Bluesky / screenshot by TechCrunch The platform specified in a post that the likes of a user can be accessed through the API because they are public. While the native client doesn’t show them, other apps can choose to include functionality to display the likes of other users. Additionally, the social network added the ability to suggest people to mention when someone types an “@” in the composer. This update is available across platforms. In another composer-related enhancement, Bluesky added an emoji picker on the web. In its latest update, Bluesky is also adding notifications to its mobile apps. Earlier this week, Bluesky added rate limits to actions, like resetting passwords or updating the user handle to stabilize network traffic. The social media company took this action because last week after Musk announced that X would be removing the “block” feature, Bluesky briefly failed to handle the load of the new traffic on the site."
2023-08-27,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/27/teslas-china-rival-xpeng-buys-ride-hailing-giant-didis-smart-ev-assets-for-744m/,TechCrunch,Tesla’s China rival XPeng buys ride-hailing giant Didi’s smart EV assets for $744M,"Chinese electric vehicle upstart XPeng is acquiring the smart EV assets of ride-hailing giant Didi for $744 million, marking another significant alliance that the Tesla challenger has struck in recent months. In an announcement on Monday, Didi said the duo is forming a strategic partnership to “promote the global application of smart electric vehicles and technologies.” Notably, the Didi assets will become a new sub-brand called “Mona” under XPeng, which is scheduled to launch in 2024. The partnership also extends to areas including marketing, financial insurance services, charging and international expansion. The news followed on the heels of Volkswagen’s $700 million investment in Xpeng, which would see the production of two new models under the Volkswagen brand utilizing XPeng’s key ADAS technologies. Despite spending heavily on R&D, XPeng’s EV adoption remains quite limited, making up just 2.1% of China’s new energy vehicle market (including hybrids) in 2022. A partnership with Didi could potentially help it tap hundreds of millions of users in China. For the 12 months ended Q1 2023, Didi recorded 587 million active users. Imagine that these passengers, when picking their ride on the Didi platform, see XPeng’s Mona models displayed as a preferred option in the future. Furthermore, Didi’s footprint reaches beyond China with its acquisition of the Brazilian rideshare company 99 back in 2018, which has given it a boost in Latin America. Indeed, XPeng acknowledged in its filing with Hong Kong’s securities authority that the partnership “will increase the Company [XPeng]’s brand exposure and customer reach through the Seller [Didi]’s platform, which will in turn result in more business leads and unfold business opportunities for the Company in new international markets.” Like Uber, Didi has over the years formed partnerships with major auto OEMs. That included one with Volvo, where it agreed to supply autonomous driving technology to power robotaxi fleets supplied by the manufacturer. Shedding its smart car business means Didi has given up part of its car-making dream. The rideshare titan has been slowly climbing out from under the dark cloud following a series of regulatory crackdowns. At this stage, where its priority is probably to strengthen its dominance in China’s ride-sharing market, selling the money-hemorrhaging, assets-heavy EV business to an industry partner doesn’t seem like a bad idea. The remaining question is whether Didi and XPeng will join forces in the autonomous vehicle realm. XPeng itself has a large AV team, having been the most aggressive EV player in China in terms of software development investment. And there’s no sign of slowdown in part of the business despite the recent loss of its AV head. The seas of driving data gleaned by Didi’s platform no doubt could be an invaluable asset for XPeng in training its autonomous driving algorithms. More to come — this is a developing story…"

One note to share: These days, I’m a semi-regular guest on TechCrunch’s Equity Podcast, including an episode that aired Friday that covers robotaxis, Nvidia’s earning, plus Better.com and startups that are full of shit (you’ll get the joke if you listen).

The battery business keeps attracting capital. Just take a look at Swedish lithium-ion battery producer Northvolt. The company raised around $1.2 billion in a convertible note from BlackRock and various Canadian pension plans. Participants in the round included Goldman Sachs, Volkswagen, Baillie Gifford, Swedbank Robur, Singapore’s GIC and Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook Enterprises. That cash will be used to build new factories in North America and Europe. Northvolt has been on a bit of tear the past few years — even before the big battery boom really took off. The company has raised $9 billion in debt and equity since 2017, including $1.1 billion in convertible notes last year. The company has also secured more than $55 billion in orders from customers like BMW, Fluence, Scania, Volvo and Volkswagen. The Northvolt deal gives me another chance to plug a collection of articles we put together earlier this month on the one-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, including a look at how startups have benefited and a map that tracks all the battery factories in North America. Once Northvolt picks a location for this next factory, we’ll update the map. Other deals that caught my attention … Accure, a startup that uses AI to predict lithium-ion battery failures, raised $7.8 million in a Series A2 round led by Blue Bear Capital and HSBC Asset Management with participation from Riverstone Holdings and Capnamic Ventures. Channel19, a startup that developed software for refrigerated trucking companies, raised $2.7 million in pre-seed and seed funding rounds led by Augment Ventures with participation by Accion Venture Lab, TMV, Overton Venture Capital and Refashiond Ventures. Several Silicon Valley and freight tech industry angels also participated, according to the company. Electric Era, a startup founded by former SpaceX engineers that developed software and hardware to make EV charging stations faster and more reliable, raised $11.5 million in a Series A round led by HSBC’s asset management arm. Climate-tech fund Blackhorn, lithium-mining giant SQM and mobility-focused investor Proeza also participated. NaaS Technology Inc., an EV charging service company in China, said it plans to acquire Charge Amps AB in a deal valued at $66.4 million. Nickelytics, an advertising tech startup focused on rideshare, has been acquired by Texas-based venture capital group T72 Club Inc. Terms were not disclosed. Zeekr, the Chinese EV maker under Geely Holdings, is kicking off its roadshow with investors ahead of its initial public offering, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources. Zeekr’s aim is a share sale that will push its valuation over $13 billion. Zeekr filed confidentially for an IPO back in December and raised $750 million in February. If Zeekr is successful and actually lists, this could be one of the largest Chinese IPOs in the past two years. Chinese companies listing on U.S. exchanges haven’t had the smoothest of rides. Didi, which raised $4.4 billion in its June 2021 IPO, ran up against Chinese regulators. The company delisted later that year. A few other Chinese companies, including Hesai, are dipping their toes back in the U.S. IPO waters now that there is more regulatory clarity in both countries. Last year, the U.S. and China struck a deal that allows American officials to review audit documents of Chinese businesses that trade in the United States, an agreement expected to lower the likelihood of Chinese companies on U.S. exchanges delisting.  Polestar plans to make Mobileye’s hands-off, eyes-off automated driving technology (called Chauffeur) available to owners of the upcoming Polestar 4 electric SUV coupe. The vehicle, which launched in China and will hit global markets in 2024, comes standard with Mobileye’s SuperVision advanced driver assistance system. Polestar plans to add Chauffeur at a later date, but did not specify when. Tesla shareholders who sued the company for financial losses stemming from Elon Musk’s “funding secured” tweet in 2018 are set to receive compensation now that the case has been settled. The SEC said 3,350 eligible claimants will share in the $42.3 million payout. Speaking of Tesla, CEO Elon Musk livestreamed a test drive of FSD Beta v12 — a yet-to-be-released version of its automated driving software (the video has since been posted on YouTube by a number of people). To be clear, this is not a self-driving car; it is ADAS that requires a human to be ready to intervene at any time. The 40-minute video showed the vehicle handling roundabouts and intersections and even some construction. At about the 19-minute mark Musk had to intervene and take control of the vehicle when it misread the traffic signal and tried to go through a busy intersection at the wrong time. Baidu expanded its Apollo Go driverless ride-hailing service to cover trips to and from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport. The company now operates Apollo Go robotaxis in five cities in China. Beep has partnered with self-driving software company Oxa (previously known as Oxbotica) to deploy autonomous vehicles in the United States. Jaguar Land Rover has found a use for its second-life Jaguar I-Pace batteries. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating whether Ford’s 2022 recall of nearly 49,000 Mustang Mach-E electric vehicles sufficiently addressed issues and whether more vehicles should be included in the recall. Uber is blaming high insurance rates for its decision to raise the minimum age requirement for new drivers in California to 25 years old. There are some caveats though.  General Motors’ Ultium Cells, the joint venture with LG Energy Solutions, reached an agreement with the United Auto Workers to increase pay for workers at its Ohio battery factory by an average of 25%. Wu Xinzhou, the former vice president of autonomous driving at Chinese electric vehicle maker XPeng, posted on social media site Weibo that he’s taken a job at Nvidia.  Vroom vroom!

Yes, they want to know if the team is great and the market is huge and the problem is worth solving and the solution makes sense. Of course. But another thing they are looking for is whether the founders understand the journey they are on. If you step on the VC treadmill, you’re signing up for rapid, explosive growth. You have to: If you don’t, you don’t fit into the models of how VC works. And that’s OK — not every company is suitable for VC funding. The other truth is that your funding amount includes a very literal deadline: If you run out of money, that’s the end of your company. So, before you run out of money, one of three things needs to happen: For early-stage companies, the first two options are off the table, which means you need to paint a compelling picture for another round of funding.

With this in mind, TechCrunch+ contacted a handful of authors whose work is closely tied to tech and startups. We asked them a simple question: “What book have you read this summer that you think others might enjoy?” We heard back from: From fiction to practical guides, from very recent books to a century-old one, here are their picks. The responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity. After a recent book explaining why generic marketing approaches don’t work on software developers, developer marketer Adam DuVander is now back with “Technical Content Strategy Decoded,” a more actionable follow-on explaining what companies should and shouldn’t do.

2023-08-27,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/27/better-com-had-a-miserable-com-public-debut/,TechCrunch,Better.com’s public market debut was Miserable.com,"Welcome back to The Interchange, where we take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. Better.com finally went public last week, and the stock’s performance was worse than expected. Affirm, on the other hand, saw its shares get a boost on the back of a better-than-expected earnings report. There was also a mega-raise, and an acquisition too. On another note, if you want to receive The Interchange directly in your inbox every Sunday, head here to sign up! The biggest fintech news of the week centered around Better.com’s no good, very bad public market debut. Or as my friend and colleague Alex Wilhelm described it, Better.com had a Miserable.com week. To sum it up, digital mortgage lender Better.com made its public debut on August 24. To no one’s surprise, the stock wasn’t exactly a hit with public investors. In fact, it was a resounding bomb. As of Friday, August 25, the stock had closed a mere $1.19. Shares of SPAC partner, Aurora, were trading at $17.45 on Wednesday, before Better.com officially went public. This is a company that two years ago had planned to go public at a $7.7 billion valuation. Now, we knew Better.com’s stock wouldn’t exactly perform well. But I’m not sure anyone expected it to drop so low, so fast. I had the opportunity to interview Vishal Garg, Better.com CEO and co-founder, a couple weeks ago in anticipation of the company’s going public via a SPAC merger with Aurora Acquisition Corp. I will tell you that after nearly two years of writing about the company’s multiple (and mostly botched) layoffs, all the various ways that Garg has managed to piss off former employees and execs alike, and the company’s swing from a big profit in 2020 to heavy losses in 2022 and beyond, I expected the interview to be a little awkward. The last time I had interviewed Garg was in 2020, when everyone and their brother was refinancing their homes and Better.com was raking in the cash. In the end, Garg was on his best behavior — exhibiting the charm and charisma that no doubt managed to help win over investors such as SoftBank, Activant Capital, Ping An Global Voyager Fund, Ally Financial and Citi, and others who collectively invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the company. Some highlights of the interview included the following: On that note, on the same day that Better.com went public, the average 30-year mortgage rate jumped to 7.23%, marking a 22-year high, according to Yahoo Finance. With rates this high, Better.com’s attempt to turn its business around will be even more challenging. Phil Haslett, co-founder and chief strategy officer of EquityZen, had this to say about the company’s choosing to move forward with its delayed SPAC despite all the negative headlines over the past 20 months. Via email, he wrote: “Senior leadership at Better.com (and its investors) are not surprised the stock is ‘down’ 90%. The de-SPAC was a way to raise $565M. Nobody else was going to give them $500 million. Vishal Garg saw that there was one last wedding dress for sale, and he took it. He knew it wouldn’t fit right, but he didn’t care. He got it done.” To hear the Equity podcast team riff more about the company and its bomb of a public debut, check out the below link. — Mary Ann  Image Credits: Better.com Better.com may have had a rough week, but at least one other publicly traded fintech company’s stock fared far better. Shares of Affirm’s stock were trading up nearly 30% to just under $18 on Friday afternoon after the company released its fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings. The company said it was exiting the year with achieving profitability on an adjusted operating income (AOI) basis and that its revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $446 million. And, as reported by CNBC, Affirm “also gave strong guidance for the fiscal first quarter, projecting $430 million to $455 million in revenue, versus analyst expectations of $430 million.” Third Bridge analyst Kevin Kennedy had a few thoughts on the results after interviewing a number of execs in the fintech space, telling TechCrunch that “even with generally positive results, it is hard to ignore Affirm’s continued operating losses and loss margins expanded more than 11 percentage points over the past year, resulting in a $2.6 billion accumulated deficit.” On the plus side, Kennedy also noted that the Debit+ card product was “a step in the right direction, and will likely play a key role in the path to profitability by driving better monetization of existing users without the drag of marginal customer acquisition costs.” He said he was also particularly interested to see Affirm’s increased adoption in travel, equipment and auto industries. Lastly, he said: “Our experts believe Affirm’s future as a standalone business will be contingent on the company’s ability to develop and effectively cross-sell a wider spectrum of financial services products, as the BNPL offerings of major diversified tech players like PayPal, Apple and Cash App (Block) are becoming increasingly competitive.” For context, Affirm’s stock is still trading lower than its 52-week-high of $27.26, but it’s more than double its 52-week-low of $8.62.

Haven’t been able to follow the news closely? Don’t sweat it. WiR will get you up to speed. In this edition of WiR, we cover Microsoft bringing Python to Excel, Cruise being forced to reduce its robotaxi fleet following a crash, and Amazon launching its new Fire TV Channels app. We also recap Twitter competitor Bluesky buckling under load, influencer MrBeast’s poorly timed Olympics video, IBM building a code translator for COBOL, and Snapchat expanding further into generative AI. If you haven’t already, sign up here to get WiR in your inbox every Saturday. Now, without further ado, here’s the week’s news! MrBeast’s geopolitical nightmare: Billionaire creator MrBeast inadvertently stoked generations of geopolitical tension in his latest YouTube video, in which participants from “every country on Earth” competed in “Squid Game”-like elimination challenges for a chance to win $250,000. It was the countries that weren’t included in the competition, as well as the map featured in the video, that made the stunt ripe for discourse. IBM taps AI to translate COBOL code: IBM this week unveiled Code Assistant for IBM Z, which uses a code-generating AI model to translate COBOL (one of the older programming languages in use) into Java syntax. It’s potentially quite handy, considering there’s over 800 billion lines of COBOL in use on production systems and a strong desire among many of the companies using it to migrate to more modern languages. Amazon launches Fire TV Channels app: Amazon announced Monday the launch of its new Fire TV Channels app, giving Fire TV customers access to over 400 free ad-supported TV channels, including ABC News, CBS Sports, Fox Sports, MLB, Martha Stewart and more. Bluesky struggles with growing popularity: X (formerly Twitter) competitor Bluesky buckled following Elon Musk’s announcement that X will no longer support blocking users in favor of mutes only. The company has often had to deal with an influx of users when Twitter announces particularly unwelcome changes, Sarah writes. Snapchat adds new generative AI features: Snapchat is preparing to further expand into generative AI features, after earlier launching its AI-powered chatbot My AI, which can now respond with a Snap back, not just text. With the company’s forthcoming generative AI feature called “Dreams,” Snap will again experiment with AI images — but soon, those images may contain you and your friends in imaginative backgrounds. Phone hacking company tries to keep tech secret: For years, cops and other government authorities all over the world have been using phone hacking technology provided by Cellebrite to unlock phones and obtain the data within. And the company has been keen on keeping the use of its technology “hush hush,” Lorenzo reports. Have a hankering for new podcast content? You’re in luck. TechCrunch has plenty on deck for your listening enjoyment. On Equity, the crew discussed Nvidia’s earnings report, raises from Ramp and AI-powered writing platform Lex, Northvolt’s move to North America, the story behind Better.com’s IPO and startups that are literally full of crap (it’ll make sense once you listen — trust me). Meanwhile, Found focused on Feyi Ayodele, the co-founder and CEO of CancerIQ, a precision health company designed for physicians to help their patients with monitoring cancer risk and prevention.

2023-08-26,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/26/brazil-webdetetive-spyware-deleted/,TechCrunch,A Brazilian phone spyware was hacked and victims’ devices ‘deleted’ from server,"A Portuguese-language spyware called WebDetetive has been used to compromise more than 76,000 Android phones in recent years across South America, largely in Brazil. WebDetetive is also the latest phone spyware company in recent months to have been hacked. In an undated note seen by TechCrunch, the unnamed hackers described how they found and exploited several security vulnerabilities that allowed them to compromise WebDetetive’s servers and access its user databases. By exploiting other flaws in the spyware maker’s web dashboard — used by abusers to access the stolen phone data of their victims — the hackers said they enumerated and downloaded every dashboard record, including every customer’s email address. The hackers said that dashboard access also allowed them to delete victim devices from the spyware network altogether, effectively severing the connection at the server level to prevent the device from uploading new data. “Which we definitely did. Because we could. Because #fuckstalkerware,” the hackers wrote in the note. The note was included in a cache containing more than 1.5 gigabytes of data scraped from the spyware’s web dashboard. That data included information about each customer, such as the IP address they logged in from and their purchase history. The data also listed every device that each customer had compromised, which version of the spyware the phone was running, and the types of data that the spyware was collecting from the victim’s phone. The cache did not include the stolen contents from victims’ phones. DDoSecrets, a nonprofit transparency collective that indexes leaked and exposed datasets in the public interest, received the WebDetetive data and shared it with TechCrunch for analysis. In total, the data showed that WebDetetive had compromised 76,794 devices to date at the time of the breach. The data also contained 74,336 unique customer email addresses, though WebDetetive does not verify a customer’s email addresses when signing up, preventing any meaningful analysis of the spyware’s customers. It’s not known who is behind the WebDetetive breach and the hackers did not provide contact information. TechCrunch could not independently confirm the hackers’ claim that it deleted victims’ devices from the network, though TechCrunch did verify the authenticity of the stolen data by matching a selection of device identifiers in the cache against a publicly accessible endpoint on WebDetetive’s server. WebDetetive is a type of phone monitoring app that is planted on a person’s phone without their consent, often by someone with knowledge of the phone’s passcode. Once planted, the app changes its icon on the phone’s home screen, making the spyware difficult to detect and remove. WebDetetive then immediately begins stealthily uploading the contents of a person’s phone to its servers, including their messages, call logs, phone call recordings, photos, ambient recordings from the phone’s microphone, social media apps, and real-time precise location data. Despite the broad access that these “stalkerware” (or spouseware) apps have to a victim’s personal and sensitive phone data, spyware is notoriously buggy and known for their shoddy coding, which puts victims’ already-stolen data at risk of further compromise. Little is known about WebDetetive beyond its surveillance capabilities. It’s not uncommon for spyware makers to conceal or obfuscate their real-world identities, given the reputational and legal risks that come with producing spyware and facilitating the illegal surveillance of others. WebDetetive is no different. But while the breached data itself reveals few clues about WebDetetive’s administrators, much of its roots can be traced back to OwnSpy, another widely used phone spying app. TechCrunch downloaded the WebDetetive Android app from its website (since both Apple and Google ban stalkerware apps from their app stores), and planted the app onto a virtual device, allowing us to analyze the app in an isolated sandbox without giving it any real data, such as our location. We ran a network traffic analysis to understand what data was flowing in and out of the WebDetetive app, which found it was a largely repackaged copy of OwnSpy’s spyware. WebDetetive’s user agent, which it sends to the server to identify itself, was still referring to itself as OwnSpy, even though it was uploading our virtual device’s dummy data to WebDetetive’s servers. A side-by-side photo comparison of WebDetetive (left) and OwnSpy (right) running on Android. Image Credits: TechCrunch OwnSpy is developed in Spain by Mobile Innovations, a Madrid-based company run by Antonio Calatrava. OwnSpy has operated since at least 2010, according to its website, and claims to have 50,000 customers, though it’s not known how many devices OwnSpy has compromised to date. OwnSpy also operates an affiliate model, allowing others to make a commission by promoting the app or offering “a new product to your clients” in return for OwnSpy taking a cut of the profits, according to an archived copy of its affiliate’s website. It’s not clear what other operational links, if any, exist between OwnSpy and WebDetetive. Calatrava did not return a request for comment. A short time after we emailed Calatrava, portions of OwnSpy’s known infrastructure dropped offline. A separate network traffic analysis of OwnSpy’s app by TechCrunch found that OwnSpy’s spyware app was briefly nonfunctional at the time of publication. WebDetetive’s app continues to function. WebDetetive is the second spyware maker to be targeted by a data-destructive hack in recent months. LetMeSpy, a spyware app developed by Polish developer Rafal Lidwin, shut down following a hack that exposed and deleted victims’ stolen phone data from LetMeSpy’s servers. Lidwin declined to answer questions about the incident. By TechCrunch’s count, at least a dozen spyware companies in recent years have exposed, spilled, or otherwise put victims’ stolen phone data at risk of further compromise because of shoddy coding and easily exploitable security vulnerabilities. WebDetetive founder Leonardo Duarte did not respond to a request for comment. An email sent to WebDetetive’s support email address about the data breach — including whether the spyware maker has backups — went unreturned. It’s not clear if the spyware maker will notify customers or victims of the data breach, or if it still has the data or records to do so. Destructive attacks, although infrequent, could have unintended and dangerous consequences for victims of spyware. Spyware typically alerts the abuser if the spyware app stops working or is removed from a victim’s phone, and severing a connection without a safety plan in place could put spyware victims in an unsafe situation. The Coalition Against Stalkerware, which works to support victims and survivors of stalkerware, has resources on its website for those who suspect their phone is compromised. Unlike most phone monitoring apps, WebDetetive and OwnSpy do not hide their app on an Android home screen, but instead disguise themselves as an Android system-presenting Wi-Fi app. WebDetetive is relatively easy to detect. The app appears named as “WiFi” and features a white wireless icon in a blue circle on a white background.

2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/the-mugshot-that-launched-a-thousand-memes/,TechCrunch,The mugshot that launched a thousand memes,"Memes can happen in the blink of an eye, like a Jeopardy! contestant who accidentally makes a sexual innuendo under the pressure of stage lights, or a kid who randomly gets interviewed on a playground and professes his undying love for America’s most plentiful crop, corn. But as soon as we knew former President Donald Trump would be processed at Fulton County Jail for his fourth indictment, we knew that the resulting mugshot would be all over the place for years to come, from novelty t-shirt stands to our hypothetical future childrens’ history textbooks. We waited for it, knowing that as soon as the image was released to the public, it would become unavoidable. “This will break Etsy,” Jesse Case wrote in a now-viral tweet (or X post, whatever). And sure enough, less than 24 four hours after Trump’s mugshot was released, Etsy already turns up 5,290 results to the search “trump mugshot.” Even the former president himself has already set up an extensive merch store with t-shirts, posters, mugs and stickers featuring the photo, which is accompanied by text declaring “NEVER SURRENDER!” It’s unclear if Trump chose this wording since he literally surrendered to Fulton County Jail, or if this somehow went over his team’s head. But nonetheless, Trump supporters can now buy their very own mugshot beer koozie, and yes, this sentence took a year off of my life to type. Naturally, fake mugshots circulated social media before the real thing was even released — and perhaps due to their less rigorous fact-checking standards, pop culture news accounts like Pop Base beat legacy news outlets to the punch, circulating the now ubiquitous mugshot. It didn’t matter what Trump’s mugshot would look like. No matter what, this image was going to be both a viral meme and an historically monumental artifact. But even without any editing, Trump looks yassified: his bright blonde hair shows no trace of gray, draped in a swoop across his forehead. Prison lighting is unforgiving, but combined with the over exposure of the flash, Trump almost looks younger, as the shadows smooth out the wrinkles on his left cheek. The wave of his hair is perfectly positioned in the center of his forehead, accentuating his angry countenance. At first glance, it looks as though his eyebrows and hair are one, making his scowl even more sinister, more jarring. Image Credits: Anonymous internet user, with permission to TechCrunch As TikToker Kirby Alice pointed out, there’s an irony to these historic mugshots, which aren’t very high-quality images, since, well, they’re mugshots from a county jail. “I can pretty well guarantee that whatever camera they have to take mugshots was probably purchased at like, a Radio Shack circa 2007,” she said, days before Trump turned himself in. “It might be in the back of a closet suffering heat damage in Georgia right now, and it is about to take one of the most important images in American history.” I’m reminded of a recent episode of “The Kardashians,” when Kim brought an entire hair and makeup team with her to the DMV to get her license renewed, cheating us out of the idea that awkward driver license photos are the one great equalizer of mankind. While Trump’s team surely thought long and hard about everything from his tie color to his facial expression, he wasn’t going to get any special treatment while getting processed in jail, even as some probably underpaid municipal employee pressed the shutter button to take an undoubtedly iconic photo of our lifetime. “LizaMinnelliOutlives was how I saw Trump’s mugshot,” a friend wrote to me on Discord. After all, it wasn’t that long ago that we found out that the Queen of England died due to the pronouncement that Liza Minnelli had outlived Queen Elizabeth II. After Trump’s presidency, the American right and left are so far divided that perhaps only the Donald himself could unite us once more: Everyone, regardless of their political affiliation, is making memes of Trump’s mugshot. It is, quite literally, memetic, as used in the Richard Dawkins sense. It will be circulated, remixed, repurposed and mutated until it perhaps outlives even the LizaMinnelliOutlives meme, surviving the brutal natural selection that is the attention span of digitally-addled brains. In liberal internet circles, the mugshot is a cause for celebration, an “I told you so” to relatives who were naively lured by Trump’s emboldening rhetoric almost eight years ago. And yet on Truth Social, the somewhat dormant social app that Trump himself founded, the image is a rallying cry — it’s literally being used to solicit campaign donations — yet Trump supporters still find the image funny. One Truth Social meme account edited Trump’s mugshot to replace the Mona Lisa, as crowds swarm to get a closer look. Another user advertised t-shirts with the mugshot that declare “my pronouns are Trump/won,” which also conveys a serious misunderstanding of how grammar works. You would think that nothing could be more political than a mugshot of a former president who is indicted for interfering with the democratic process. But some memes just aren’t political at all, reminding us of the absurdity of the moment. “who cares,” wrote @roastmalone_ on X (Twitter). “trump isn’t even the first actor from home alone 2 to have his mugshot released.”"
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/instacart-s1-five-takeaways/,TechCrunch,Five takeaways from Instacart’s S-1 filing,"On-demand grocery delivery giant Instacart has finally dropped its much anticipated S-1. The company, actually named MapleBear, is one of the best-known unicorns on the IPO shortlist. Instacart’s public-offering filing has been long awaited due to not only its massive fundraising history, but also its sheer anticipated heft. Instacart is, indeed, a very large private company, making its IPO filing and eventual debut a critical event for the back half of 2023. Since its 2012 inception, Instacart has raised $2.9 billion in funding, according to Crunchbase. In March 2021, the company secured a $265 million funding round from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and others, at a $39 billion valuation. After so long an IPO drought, what does Instacart have in store for its existing investors and those perhaps looking to snap up some of its shares? Below we’ve compiled five initial takeaways from its SEC documents to help understand its growth, health and business. We’ll dig more deeply into the mechanics of its grocery delivery business and the profitability of the model. Today we’re focused on the big numbers and the big trends. While Instacart certainly experienced a pandemic-fueled boom in business, it has managed to maintain that momentum even as pandemic restrictions have eased. More people could go back to the grocery store for shopping, but many got used to the convenience of having their grocery items delivered to them. Orders climbed by 18% in 2022 to 262.6 million compared to 223.4 million in 2021. Those numbers have remained more consistent in 2023 thus far, with orders totaling 132.9 million for the six months ended June 30 compared to 132.3 million the first six months of 2022. Meanwhile, gross transaction volume increased by 16% to $28.8 billion in 2022 compared to $24.9 billion in 2021. Transaction revenue surged by 44% in 2022 to $1.8 billion compared to $1.23 billion in 2021. For the first six months of 2023, transaction revenue was up 34% to $1.07 billion compared with $799 million in the first six months of 2022. That’s a lot of delivered foodstuffs. Instacart’s revenue last year came to $2.55 billion, up 39% from its 2021 result of $1.83 billion. Over the same time horizon, Instacart flipped from operating losses to operating profits, improving from -$72 million in 2021 operating income to +$71 million last year. "
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/bitcoin-startups-undercapitalized-funding-drought/,TechCrunch,Bitcoin startups remain undercapitalized as funding drought drags on,"The crypto industry has not had a great run over the past year. Along with increasing regulatory scrutiny and skeptical investors, capital deployment has pulled back significantly from the highs of 2021, which has left many young startups struggling to raise funds. This capital crunch is affecting the Bitcoin ecosystem as well. According to Erik Svenson, co-founder and CFO of blockchain infrastructure firm, Blockstream, Bitcoin-focused companies are falling behind as fewer checks are being written. “I think investment into crypto kind of peaked early last year,” Svenson said on TechCrunch’s Chain Reaction podcast this week. “But Bitcoin itself has always been an area that has been undercapitalized.” Founded in 2014, Blockstream focuses on its own sidechain technology, dubbed Liquid Network, and it has bitcoin mining operations and provides hardware wallets for bitcoin and other assets. Notably, it doesn’t have a token of its own, unlike many other crypto companies that launched their own during the initial coin offering (ICO) boom in 2017. “We decided early on not to issue our own token,” Svenson said. “We didn’t raise an ICO like many projects did, so we’ve been relying on more traditional VC investment,” he added. Blockstream raised $125 million in late January, bringing its total funding to about $400 million. The company had a post-money valuation of $2.49 billion as of August 2022, according to PitchBook data. However, it’s not been all smooth sailing for the company, especially as the crypto waters have grown choppier amid the broader funding crunch. Svenson pointed out that while Blockstream has some “really bullish Bitcoin investors” on its cap table, it also has LPs, and the turbulence in the crypto market has made things more challenging. “The LPs are trying to parse both the macroeconomic factors and then also the industry-specific direction that everybody’s experienced in the last year.” "
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/how-founders-raised-money-so-far-in-2023/,TechCrunch,How founders raised money so far in 2023,"Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday. This week, DocSend dropped a big load of statistics about the VC activity over the past half year or so. For TC+, I did a deep dive into the trends that are starting to show up. Subscribe for the full story, but since you’re a trusty reader of this fair newsletter, I’ll give you the TL;DR: Okay. Lemme put my little soapbox away and look at what else has been alive in the land of startups this week! Image Credits: Cruise “Move fast and break things” has been the mantra at Facebook/Meta for a long time. The idea is to not get shy about taking risks. That might work if the worst thing that can happen is that your aunt can’t see the picture of their niece for a few hours, but in the world of self-driving cars, that doesn’t work. This week, regulators laid down the law, telling Cruise to reduce its robotaxi fleet 50% following a crash (with a fire truck, no less. You know, those small, quiet, and subtle vehicles that are so easy to miss). Personally, I keep doing double takes when I see the little Chevy Bolt EVs cruising around in San Francisco without anyone in the driver’s seat, but maybe that’s just me. One cool nugget of news is that CATL, who, among other things, supplies batteries to Tesla, showed off a battery that can charge 400 km in 10 minutes. Super cool. Apropos Tesla, our transportation team has been kept hella busy with the EV manufacturer this week. It said that the data breach impacting 75,000 employees was an insider job (whoops), and the company launched cheaper Model X and Model S options with less range and tried to reassure Chinese users on data security amid spying concerns. A grieving widow also sued the company over a deadly Model 3 crash and explosion. We would say that Musk has his hands full with his pet car company, but it seems his attention is mostly on making sure you won’t be able to “block” people anymore on the Platform Formerly Known as Twitter. That sounds like an idea. Not a good idea by any measure, but an idea nonetheless. One aspect of EVs that’s worth keeping an eye on from a startup perspective is their insatiable need for batteries. That plays out in lots of different ways in different markets, but worth noting this week is Swedish EV battery maker Northvolt raising $1.2 billion to expand to North America and GM partnering with startup Mitra Chem to develop affordable EV batteries. And Rebecca took a closer look at the EV battery factory construction boom across North America. Free falling: It’s rough out there in the stock markets. For example, EV maker VinFast is still worth more than Ford and GM even after its stock took a 19% nosedive. Toot toot, pew pew: Harri and I had a ton of fun driving around in Las Vegas on an Arcimoto at CES this year. It strikes me as a bit of a head scratcher to hear that the startup hooked up with a defense contractor. The bombs and rockets industry isn’t known for its green cred, and the vehicles don’t seem rugged enough for even the lightest of off-roading, but it’s one to keep an eye on for sure. Anywhere here is fine, driver: It seems like reports that people are getting hot and heavy in the back of robotaxis and the aforementioned crashes are a reminder that all press is good press: Cruise and Waymo are seeing a surge in robotaxi app downloads. Image Credits: Bryce Durbin As we were dredging through the thousands of TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 200 companies, we kept noticing that the trend we spotted at CES earlier this year continues: We are seeing a huge amount of waste recycling, poop and urine startups. This past week, we saw two global payments companies release earnings with wildly different results. Uruguayan fintech company dLocal saw its stock surge by over 30% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, shares of Dutch payments processor Adyen sank “to their lowest level in more than three years” on Friday, as reported by Reuters and others. Christine and Mary Ann compare and contrast what’s going on in our sibling newsletter, The Interchange. Which, incidentally, is well worth subscribing to. Apropos crap — after I went out of my way to buy a guest article on TechCrunch (spoiler alert: I failed, but I learned some things along the way), we rebooted our program for non-crap guest posts. Okay, fine, it’s not all crap news this week, although there’s def some highs and lows: That’s a heavy haircut: Fintech startup Ramp raises $300 million at a $ 5.5 billion valuation. That sounds pretty good, until you remember that the company last raised in March last year at a  $8.1 billion valuation. I wouldn’t like to be the CEO in the boardroom when they admit to having to take a 28% valuation cut. . . . Hope springs infernal: Alex is one of the most enthusiastic cheerleaders for tech IPOs that I know, and he’s bouncing around like an overcaffeinated toddler at the idea that everyone’s talking about tech IPOs again. Read about it over on TC+.

And then I look at what is performing well on the site, before sighing and muttering, “Here we go again.” Artificial Intelligence continues to be hot, hot, hot. This week, the tool that caught my eye was Moemate, an assistant that analyzes what is actually happening on your screen to offer context-aware advice and support. To me, it sounds like a bit of a privacy nightmare, but the idea is fascinating. Kyle reports spotty but curious results. OpenAI goes shopping: As far as we know, OpenAI acquiring AI design studio Global Illumination is the first acquisition the company has made since it was founded seven years ago. Content is king: Large language models are awesome and all, but the datasets contained within them are often kept a secret. That has some interesting issues. The Allen Institute for AI is taking a different tack and just dropped the biggest open dataset yet for training language models. A network you can swim in: The lingo comes fast and hard in the land of artificial intelligence, and my favorite deep dive this week (pun intended) was Brian’s article on liquid neural networks — ones that can continue to adapt even after the model is trained.

2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/vfx-artists-show-that-hollywood-can-use-ai-to-create-not-exploit/,TechCrunch,"VFX artists show that Hollywood can use AI to create, not exploit","Hollywood may be embroiled in ongoing labor disputes that involve AI, but the technology infiltrated film and TV long, long ago. At SIGGRAPH in LA, algorithmic and generative tools were on display in countless talks and announcements. We may not know where the likes of GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion fit in yet, but the creative side of production is ready to embrace them — if it can be done in a way that augments rather than replaces artists. SIGGRAPH isn’t a film and TV production conference, but one about computer graphics and visual effects (for 50 years now!), and the topics naturally have overlapped more and more in recent years. This year, the elephant in the room was the strike, and few presentations or talks got into it; however, at afterparties and networking events it was more or less the first thing anyone brought up. Even so, SIGGRAPH is very much a conference about bringing together technical and creative minds, and the vibe I got was “it sucks, but in the meantime we can continue to improve our craft.” The fears around AI in production are, not to say illusory, but certainly a bit misleading. Generative AI like image and text models have improved greatly, leading to worries that they will replace writers and artists. And certainly studio executives have floated harmful — and unrealistic — hopes of partly replacing writers and actors using AI tools. But AI has been present in film and TV for quite a while, performing important and artist-driven tasks. I saw this on display in numerous panels, technical paper presentations and interviews. Of course a history of AI in VFX would be interesting, but for the present here are some ways AI in its various forms was being shown at the cutting edge of effects and production work. One early example came in a pair of Pixar presentations about animation techniques used in their latest film, Elemental. The characters in this movie are more abstract than others, and the prospect of making a person who is made of fire, water or air is no easy one. Imagine wrangling the fractal complexity of these substances into a body that can act and express itself clearly while still looking “real.” As animators and effects coordinators explained one after another, procedural generation was core to the process, simulating and parameterizing the flames or waves or vapors that made up dozens of characters. Hand sculpting and animating every little wisp of flame or cloud that wafts off a character was never an option — this would be extremely tedious, labor-intensive and technical rather than creative work. But as the presentations made clear, although they relied heavily on sims and sophisticated material shaders to create the desired effects, the artistic team and process were deeply intertwined with the engineering side. (They also collaborated with researchers at ETH Zurich for the purpose.) One example was the overall look of one of the main characters, Ember, who is made of flame. It wasn’t enough to simulate flames or tweak the colors or adjust the many dials to affect the outcome. Ultimately the flames needed to reflect the look the artist wanted, not just the way flames appear in real life. To that end they employed “volumetric neural style transfer” or NST; style transfer is a machine learning technique most will have experienced by, say, having a selfie changed to the style of Edvard Munch or the like. In this case the team took the raw voxels of the “pyro simulation,” or generated flames, and passed it through a style transfer network trained on an artist’s expression of what they wanted the character’s flames to look like: more stylized, less simulated. The resulting voxels have the natural, unpredictable look of a simulation but also the unmistakable cast of the artist’s choice. Simplified example of NST in action adding style to Ember’s flames. Image Credits: Pixar Of course the animators are sensitive to the idea that they just generated the film using AI, which is not the case. “If anyone ever tells you that Pixar used AI to make Elemental, that’s wrong,” said Pixar’s Paul Kanyuk pointedly during the presentation. “We used volumetric NST to shape her silhouette edges.” (To be clear, NST is a machine learning technique we would identify as falling under the AI umbrella, but the point Kanyuk was making is that it was used as a tool to achieve an artistic outcome — nothing was simply “made with AI.”) Later, other members of the animation and design teams explained how they used procedural, generative or style transfer tools to do things like recolor a landscape to fit an artist’s palette or mood board, or fill in city blocks with unique buildings mutated from “hero” hand-drawn ones. The clear theme was that AI and AI-adjacent tools were there to serve the purposes of the artists, speeding up tedious manual processes and providing a better match with the desired look. Images from Nimona, which DNEG animated. Image Credits: DNEG I heard a similar note from Martine Bertrand, senior AI researcher at DNEG, the VFX and post-production outfit that most recently animated the excellent and visually stunning Nimona. She explained that many existing effects and production pipelines are incredibly labor-intensive, in particular look development and environment design. (DNEG also did a presentation, “Where Proceduralism Meets Performance” that touches on these topics.) “People don’t realize that there’s an enormous amount of time wasted in the creation process,” Bertrand told me. Working with a director to find the right look for a shot can take weeks per attempt, during which infrequent or bad communication often leads to those weeks of work being scrapped. It’s incredibly frustrating, she continued, and AI is a great way to accelerate this and other processes that are nowhere near final products, but simply exploratory and general. Artists using AI to multiply their efforts “enables dialogue between creators and directors,” she said. Alien jungle, sure — but like this? Or like this? A mysterious cave, like this? Or like this? For a creator-led, visually complex story like Nimona, getting fast feedback is especially important. Wasting a week rendering a look that the director rejects a week later is a serious production delay. In fact new levels of collaboration and interactivity are being achieved in early creative work like pre-visualization, as one talk by Sokrispy CEO Sam Wickert explained. His company was tasked with doing pre-vis for the outbreak scene at the very start of HBO’s “The Last of Us” — a complex “oner” in a car with countless extras, camera movements and effects. While the use of AI was limited in that more grounded scene, it’s easy to see how improved voice synthesis, procedural environment generation and other tools could and did contribute to this increasingly tech-forward process. Final shot, mocap data, mask and 3D environment generated by Wonder Studio. Image Credits: Wonder Studio Wonder Dynamics, which was cited in several keynotes and presentations, offers another example of use of machine learning processes in production — entirely under the artists’ control. Advanced scene and object recognition models parse normal footage and instantly replace human actors with 3D models, a process that once took weeks or months. But as they told me a few months ago, the tasks they automate are not the creative ones — it’s grueling rote (sometimes roto) labor that involves almost no creative decisions. “This doesn’t disrupt what they’re doing; it automates 80-90% of the objective VFX work and leaves them with the subjective work,” co-founder Nikola Todorovic said then. I caught up with him and his co-founder, actor Tye Sheridan at SIGGRAPH, and they were enjoying being the toast of the town: it was clear that the industry was moving in the direction they had started off in years ago. (Incidentally, come see Sheridan on the AI stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in September.) That said, the warnings of writers and actors striking are in no way being dismissed by the VFX community. They echo them, in fact, and their concerns are similar — if not quite as existential. For an actor, one’s likeness or performance (or for a writer, one’s imagination and voice) is one’s livelihood, and the threat of it being appropriated and automated entirely is a terrifying one. For artists elsewhere in the production process, the threat of automation is also real, and also more of a people problem than a technology one. Many people I spoke to agreed that bad decisions by uninformed leaders are the real problem. “AI looks so smart that you may defer your decision-making process to the machine,” said Bertrand. “And when humans defer their responsibilities to machines, that’s where it gets scary.” If AI can be harnessed to enhance or streamline the creative process, such as by reducing time spent on repetitive tasks or enabling creators with smaller teams or budgets to match their better-resourced peers, it could be transformative. But if the creative process is seconded to AI, a path some executives seem keen to explore, then despite the technology already pervading Hollywood, the strikes will just be getting started."
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/whatsapp-rolls-out-support-for-hd-video/,TechCrunch,WhatsApp rolls out support for HD video,"Last week, WhatsApp announced it was adding support for HD photos, allowing the messaging app users the option to preserve the high-def resolution of the phones they wanted to share with friends and family. At the time, the company said support for HD videos was coming soon. Today, the company confirmed with TechCrunch that HD video support is now rolling out to both iOS and Android users. Similar to the HD photos feature, the HD videos feature gives customers the choice to share high-def videos across WhatsApp. Previously, high-def videos would have been compressed to 480p, as per the app’s prior resolution limit. Now, users can opt to send their video in HD, but only up to 720p. The process here is the same as for sharing HD photos. After selecting the video or videos you want to share, you’ll tap the new HD button on the top of the screen. A dialog box will appear where you can confirm if you want to share in Standard Quality or HD Quality and will show the associated file sizes. You then press send to share the video as usual. Images and videos shared on WhatsApp are protected with the company’s end-to-end encryption. The recipient will see a small HD badge on the video shared in the app that lets them know you’ve shared in HD. This lets them decide if they have the storage space or bandwidth available to view the video you’ve shared in HD quality at the time. The feature is rolling out now so if you don’t have it yet, you should soon."
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/the-6-most-important-things-to-know-about-saas-product-architecture/,TechCrunch,The 6 most important things to know about SaaS+ product architecture,"Whether you want to build a SaaS+ company from scratch or turn an existing company into a business that can monetize embedded products and services, these are the six key concepts you need to know. These concepts have technical implications but are as much business logic decisions as architectural ones. A founding team should have a shared perspective on these six issues. Being aligned on these concepts will drive product roadmap, core technical architecture, pricing strategy and product marketing. You can 10x the revenue of your SaaS company by putting the right building blocks in place from the start. If you build the foundation of your SaaS+ house correctly, you can remodel the interior fairly easily in the coming years. Shopping cart functionality and flexibility at the transaction level are two of the critical technical elements in SaaS+ because a high percentage of revenue typically revolves around the flow of funds on the platform. There are a couple things to think about when building transaction technology: For the end user, it all boils down to the checkout experience. Whether a given transaction is leveraging multimerchant cart technology or split transaction tools, the choice should be invisible to the end user while also accommodating a myriad of different SaaS+ products sold at checkout.

			Being aligned on these concepts will drive product roadmap, core technical architecture, pricing strategy and product marketing.

 Example: At SportsEngine, we built a commerce system where customers use one shopping cart to check out, but each item is actually being bought separately. The customer enters their payment information only once, after which the platform initiates multiple transactions on their card behind the scenes. So, for example, they can register for Minnesota Hockey and USA Hockey in one step, while also buying insurance and their uniform in the same transaction. One cart, one checkout . . . four independent vendors. Etsy also allows customers to buy from multiple merchants in a single transaction. The marketplace then splits the payment between the different vendors and themselves. DoorDash’s single vendor shopping cart allows you to add multiple dishes from a single restaurant, but to order from two different restaurants, you need to make separate orders. Don’t silo your data. You want to create one profile per person and use it everywhere on your platform. This means: one profile, one payment method, one background screen and one rating system for each human. Build your data model so each person’s profile and information is available across the entire platform. This is the power of the platform. "
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/tesla-investors-might-get-payout-from-sec-settlement/,TechCrunch,Tesla investors might get payout from SEC settlement,"Tesla shareholders who claimed to face financial losses after CEO Elon Musk tweeted about taking the company private might be on the verge of receiving compensation from a $42.3 million fund established as part of Musk’s federal securities fraud settlement. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission said 3,350 eligible claimants will share in the payout, recouping almost 52% of their losses, according to a Wednesday night court filing in the Southern District of New York Court. The compensation to investors comes several months after Musk was found not liable in a class-action securities fraud trial that explored how the CEO’s now infamous “funding secured” tweet caused volatility in the stock, resulting in losses of money. If Musk had lost the trial, he’d have paid out billions of dollars in damages to investors. The fund comes from a 2018 settlement with the SEC over the tweet. After the SEC filed a complaint alleging Musk lied when he tweeted he had secured funding for a private takeover of the company at $420 per share, Musk agreed to step down as chairman of Tesla and pay a $20 million fine. Tesla agreed to pay a separate $20 million penalty. The total amount grew to $42.3 million with interest payments. U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan said Thursday he hopes to approve the payouts by September 1 or shortly afterward. The SEC settlement also included a stipulation that Musk agree to let a Tesla lawyer approve some of his Twitter posts. Musk has sought to scrap that decree, calling it a “muzzle” on his right to free speech. In May, Judge Liman, who oversees the case, denied the motion to end the decree. Musk is expected to appeal that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court."
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/onlyfans-profitability-creator-economy/,TechCrunch,OnlyFans’ profitability proves the creator economy boom was real enough,"Like many sectors, creator-focused startups had an easy time of attracting funding in 2020 and 2021. But venture capital investment into this category slowed down significantly starting in the second half of 2022: going from 42 rounds worth $336 million in Q2 2022, to only 19 rounds worth $110.2 million in Q3 2022. At the time, Nate O’Brien of Roadrunner VC said it best: “The creator bubble is popping.” The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. As is often the case with hyped sectors, they end up deflating when the market isn’t favorable. And it gets worse if you’re in a category that depends on the fickle advertising market, which is strongly exposed to macroeconomic fluctuations. But more importantly, the rise of the creator economy was largely driven by factors that proved to be quite temporary. “The growth in the creator space was fueled in two parts: by COVID and [by] the boom in e-commerce (the primary advertiser in the creator economy). People have largely returned to their ordinary lives, and e-commerce has reverted to its usual pace, so the slower growth of the creator space is not surprising,” Coventure partner Brian Harwitt told TechCrunch+ in a recent investor survey. Sure, it isn’t surprising, but it still means that new startups hoping to solve problems for creators and help them generate revenue are today often struggling to raise money, and probably expand as well. Venture rounds and younger startups form only part of the picture, though. There are many outliers to be found if you simply examine the set of companies that raised plenty of cash before the ad market started to cool down, and chief among them is OnlyFans. It’s actually one of the best companies in the space right now, period. It’s often difficult to get a good picture of the state of some businesses, especially late-stage startups and large private tech companies, as we usually only have incomplete or delayed data to study. With OnlyFans, we have strong and complete information; it’s simply dated. Thanks to data from its British parent Fenix International, we have OnlyFans’ results for its fiscal year ended November 30, 2022, which is basically all of calendar 2022. Huzzah! "
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/uber-squeezed-by-insurance-increases-minimum-age-for-new-drivers-in-california/,TechCrunch,"Uber, squeezed by insurance, increases minimum age for new drivers in California","Uber has raised the minimum age requirement for new rides-hailing drivers in California to 25 years old due to what it described as “baselessly higher” commercial insurance costs in the state. The new policy will only apply to new drivers planning to use the rideshare platform. Those who plan to use the app to make deliveries through Uber Eats only need to be 19 years old. Any driver on the rideshare platform, who is already approved and under 25 years old can continue to shuttle passengers, the company said. “California’s insurance coverage requirements for rideshare are baselessly higher than nearly every other car on the road: up to thirty times that of taxis and thirty times that of personal vehicles,” an Uber spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “As a result of these lopsided requirements, personal injury attorneys have created a cottage industry specializing in suing rideshare platforms like ours, pushing Uber’s California state-mandated commercial insurance costs to rise by more than 65% in just two years. By increasing the age requirement for new drivers to 25, we hope to mitigate the growth of those costs. We hope to work with lawmakers, policy leaders, and industry experts to discuss legislative and regulatory changes that will improve the experience for all California drivers.” Uber has said that California regulations for insuring commercial rideshare has pushed costs 10 times higher than those required for taxis in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Uber has differentiated itself from rival Lyft by maintaining a lower minimum driving age the past few years — a strategy that widened its pool of available drivers. In 2020, Lyft pushed its a minimum driving age to 25 years old in every U.S. state except for New York, where it is still 19. Uber’s minimum age for drivers shuttling people is 21 years old in the rest of the United States."
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/youtube-demystifies-the-shorts-algorithm-views-and-answers-other-creator-questions/,TechCrunch,"YouTube demystifies the Shorts algorithm, views and answers other creator questions","YouTube this week put out a new video meant to address creators’ questions over its short-form video platform, YouTube Shorts. The questions it answered ranged from how the algorithm for Shorts differs from long-form YouTube to what counts as a view as well as those that addressed other best practices for creators who want to maximize their potential on Shorts. While YouTube didn’t necessarily give away its secret sauce by publishing the algorithm details, as TikTok and Instagram have done, it did offer some high-level insights aimed at guiding creators making videos for Shorts. According to the product lead for Shorts, Todd Sherman, the Shorts algorithm differs from the long-form algorithm where people are tapping on videos to watch — essentially making a specific choice that then drives more recommendations. But on Shorts, people are swiping through content not knowing what comes next. While both recommendation systems are designed to present videos that people will value and enjoy, the Shorts feed prioritizes a more diverse feed because people are flipping through hundreds of videos versus maybe 10 or 20 in long-form.  Sherman also noted that not every flip in Shorts is counted as a view, either — a difference from some other platforms where viewing the first frame is counted as a view. (TikTok counts views as soon as a video starts to play, it’s said). On Shorts, however, the view is meant to reflect that the user had some intent to watch so creators have some “meaningful threshold” that someone meant to watch the view. The company doesn’t publish what its view threshold is, though, because it does tweak it from time to time, and it doesn’t want people to try to game the system. In addition, Sherman said there’s not a certain length that benefits creators to get their videos seen — instead, creators should think about how long they need to tell their story. But he also stressed that Shorts will remain focused on videos that are 60 seconds and under, so as not to blur the lines with YouTube itself. This differs from rival TikTok, which has been experimenting with letting creators record longer videos after first popularizing the short-form format. Another interesting insight offered by the product lead was that YouTube doesn’t want Shorts creators to bother with making custom thumbnails as they do on YouTube, because most thumbnails are never seen. The Shorts video shelf where thumbnails would be viewed is just an entry point to the Shorts experience — but once you’re swiping through, you won’t see the other videos’ thumbnails. He also added that hashtags can be useful and meaningful, and creators should be using them but it’s hard to generalize this advice. Time of day in publishing is also not a factor to optimize for, with the exception of someone focused on news where the freshness of the information being shared would matter. The quantity of Shorts published is also not a factor in gaining traction — it’s more about quality over quantity. Sherman also explained why Shorts will sometimes take off and then just have their view counts drop, leading creators to complain they’ve gotten “stuck.” “There are parts of the algorithm that try and find people, find creators an audience,” Sherman explained. “And sometimes those algorithms will go and effectively find like a seed audience, find a set of people that may enjoy your video. And depending on how that goes, it may get a lot more traffic or it may taper off,” he said. He also recommended against deleting and reposting Shorts in an effort to have them take off, given the risk that’s seen as spam. The company says it doesn’t think about Shorts as cannibalizing long-form, but rather has plans to introduce ways that will allow creators to link from their Shorts to their long-form videos by the end of September. However, it recently disabled links in other parts of the Shorts experience as a spam-prevention measure. Elsewhere on YouTube, the company says it will test a new feature where channels that upload a lot — those with multiple current uploads, for example — will have them all bundled together on a shelf. That way, viewers can explore everything from that channel but those won’t push down other videos in the subscriptions feed."

The company’s highest-tier “all the space you need” storage plan will now be capped. With this new change, customers who purchase a Dropbox Advanced plan with three active licenses will receive 15TB of storage space shared by the team — enough space to store about 100 million documents, 4 million photos or 7,500 hours of HD video, Dropbox says. Each additional active license will receive 5TB of storage. “We found a growing number of customers were buying Advanced subscriptions not to run a business or organization, but instead for purposes like crypto and Chia mining, unrelated individuals pooling storage for personal use cases, or even instances of reselling storage,” the company wrote in a blog post. “In recent months, we’ve seen a surge of this behavior in the wake of other services making similar policy changes. We’ve observed that customers like these frequently consume thousands of times more storage than our genuine business customers, which risks creating an unreliable experience for all of our customers.” The change comes as Google removed the “as much storage as you need” product branding for its highest-tier Workspace plan in May, as noted by Bloomberg.  Current customers using less than 35TB of storage per license, which is the case for over 99% of Advanced customers, will be able to keep the total amount of storage their team is using at the time they’re notified, plus an additional 5TB credit of pooled storage, for five years at no additional charge to their existing plan. For the less than 1% of customers utilizing 35TB or more of storage per license, they will be able to continue utilizing their current storage amount at the time you’re notified, plus an additional 5TB credit of pooled storage for one year (up to 1,000TB total), at no additional charge to their existing plan. For customers who need additional space, storage add-ons will be available for purchase for new customers on September 18 and existing customers on November 1 at 1TB for $10/month if purchased monthly or $8/month if purchased annually. Dropbox will start gradually migrating existing customers to the new policy on November 1. The company says it will notify all customers at least 30 days prior to their planned migration date."

The California-based startup, which went public in 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, is developing electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commercial service, as well as for the U.S. Department of Defense. The Toyota-backed company also has a partnership lined up with Delta Air Lines for airline customers traveling to and from airports. Joby and Delta are looking to roll out the service in New York and Los Angeles first.   Joby occupies a 120,000-square-foot facility at Marina Municipal Airport in Marina, California, where it produces pilot prototypes and conducts testing of its aircraft. But the company, keen to grow, has plans to build a large-scale factory.  Joby has been deliberating for months over where to build the 580,000-square-foot aircraft manufacturing facility. Multiple states, including California and Michigan, have been competing to land the deal. Joby CEO JoeBen Bevirt told investors during the company’s second-quarter earnings call that there has been a “remarkable amount of interest” from states in hosting this facility. Marina and the Coleman A. Young Municipal Airport in Detroit were reportedly on the company’s short list for where to set up shop. Now sources tell TechCrunch that Ohio and North Carolina are the two locations under consideration, with both Marina and Detroit out of contention.  In response to TechCrunch’s request for comment, Joby said it has made “no final decisions” on the site of the factory. “As we have previously announced, we are in the process of selecting a location for our scaled manufacturing facility,” a spokesperson said. “We have received a considerable amount of interest from states around the country and we continue to work to secure the very best long-term solution and incentive package.” North Carolina is home to many major manufacturing initiatives, including Joby partner Toyota’s $5.9 billion investment in a new electric vehicle battery factory. The state has also expressed interest in attracting advanced aviation companies: In 2020, the North Carolina Department of Transportation welcomed Chinese company EHang, which demonstrated its autonomous eVTOL air taxi for the first time, in a move that was likely also meant to signal its friendliness to advanced air mobility overall. But Joby does not have any known roots in North Carolina. Not so for Ohio, where Joby has a well-established presence. Joby registered as a company in the state that operates an electric aircraft technology simulator in the Dayton-Springfield area. An Ohio location would also put them strategically proximate to the Air Force’s Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Joby already has a well-established relationship with the USAF: Earlier this year, the company announced a $55 million increase to an existing contract to supply the Air Force with electric aircraft. According to sources, Ohio has tried to sweeten the deal with a proposed incentive package of $110 million, though additional details about the incentives package are unclear. Early last month, the company announced that it had received a key certificate from regulators giving it the green light to start flight testing its first production prototype aircraft. The Special Airworthiness Certificate from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is an important step toward achieving full FAA certification, a prerequisite to commencing commercial operations in 2025. Setting up this new manufacturing facility will no doubt play a major role in hitting those milestones. The facility in Marina is set up to produce “tens of aircraft per year,” Bevirt told press last month; this new site would increase that number to the hundreds. The company is also supported by a long-term partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. The automotive behemoth is Joby’s largest external investor, pouring around $400 million into the company; the two firms also signed an agreement that will see Toyota supplying key components for Joby’s aircraft.  "
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/sample-series-a-pitch-deck-busright/,TechCrunch,Pitch Deck Teardown: BusRight’s $7M Series A deck,"As soon as I saw the cover slide for BusRight, I knew I was looking at something really interesting. BusRight is a school-bus management platform that aims to improve efficiency and safety by, among other things, allowing caregivers to track bus locations. It also offers route-mapping and real-time GPS. Running a school bus network is complex, and in a world where tech savviness is variable, creating tools is crucial. I’m not a parent myself, but I’m going to hazard a bold assumption that, in general, losing kids on the way home from school is pretty unpopular. Somewhere in that latticework of challenges, there’s an opportunity, which BusRight jumped on. It was then able to grow the product into a business worthy of a $7 million cash injection. We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.  BusRight’s pitch deck is well-designed and full of careful touches. Here are some highlights: It’s tempting to dive into the unit economics, the growth trajectories and all the ways that the problem is awful and the solution is genius and the product delights. But in the middle of all that, the customer sometimes gets forgotten. For some companies, the customers aren’t a focus and can safely be glossed over. In this case, however, reminding investors whose lives they are helping is a really nice and elegant touch: [Slide 3] Hello, Derek. Image Credits: BusRightThe slide does a great job humanizing who is affected by the problem being solved. I don’t know much about schools, but I can imagine that being the transportation director for a school district is an arduous job. If everything works perfectly, the buses would pick the children up and drop them off on time every time. But perfection doesn’t exist: Buses break down, people are late and incidents happen. Putting upfront why this is a problem worth solving — and who it’s affecting — is a great strategy. The lesson here is to think about the human angle of the story you want to tell. If you thought the Derek slide was heartwarming, you’re not alone. But if you’re an investor, your next logical question is likely: “How many Dereks are there?” Almost presciently, BusRight answers that exact question on the very next slide: [Slide 4] Maximum Derek! Image Credits: BusRightBusRight could very easily have made this point on Slide 3, but answering the question before anyone has time to ask it? Insert chef’s kiss here. Wait, I’m in charge of this article. I can insert a literal chef’s kiss. I love my job. Carlton Carlson’s chef’s kiss from the Simpsons. Image Credits: “The Simpsons” Illustrating how the BusRight product is a win all around for kids, parents, bus drivers and the machinery that powers everything helps plant a seed that this might be a win for investors, too. Very well done: [Slide 6] Bussin’ a move. Image Credits: BusRightShowing the value propositions for each of your stakeholders is a smooth way to nail home the point. Including the “we don’t know how we functioned without it” quote underneath is just the cherry on top of the icing on top of the whipped cream on the cupcake. It’s so well done I want to, well, invest. In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things BusRight could have improved or done differently. The first few slides are great, but the company made some pretty big goofs along the way, too, so there’s plenty to learn from. I’m also including the full pitch deck, so you can get the full example! A lot of the time, the problem with a pitch deck isn’t what is there; it’s what is missing. There’s a checklist I use when evaluating decks for my pitch coaching clients, and BusRight left out some pretty significant information, and I imagine investors weren’t happy about that.  "
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/moveit-mass-hack-by-the-numbers/,TechCrunch,"MOVEit, the biggest hack of the year, by the numbers","The mass-exploitation of MOVEit Transfer software has rapidly cemented itself as the largest hack of the year so far. While the full impact of the attack will likely remain untold for months to come, there are now more than 1,000 known victims of the MOVEit breach, according to cybersecurity company Emsisoft. This milestone makes the MOVEit breach not just the largest hack of 2023 — but also one of the largest in recent history. The fallout began in May when Progress disclosed a zero-day vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer, its managed file transfer service used by thousands of organizations around the world to move large amounts of often-sensitive data over the internet. The critical-rated vulnerability allowed attackers — specifically the notorious Clop ransomware and extortion gang — to raid MOVEit Transfer servers and steal customers’ sensitive data stored within. Since then, Clop’s attacks and threats to publish the stolen data if it doesn’t receive payments have continued unabated, as have the number of known victim organizations, known impacted individuals and the costs associated with the fallout. We take a look at the MOVEit mass hack by the numbers. Just as the number of known victim organizations crossed the 1,000 milestone on August 25, the number of impacted individuals also surpassed the 60 million mark. This figure, published by Emsisoft, is sourced from state breach notifications, SEC regulatory filings and other public disclosures. Emsisoft notes that while there will invariably be some overlap in terms of individuals impacted, the number is only likely to increase as more organizations continue to confirm MOVEit-related data breaches. U.S.-based organizations account for 83.9% of known MOVEit corporate victims, according to Emisoft’s researchers. Organizations in Germany account for about 3.6% of total victims, followed by Canadian companies at 2.6% and firms in the United Kingdom at 2.1%. In July, U.S. government services contracting giant Maximus became the largest victim of the MOVEit breach after confirming that hackers accessed the protected health information — including Social Security numbers — of as many as 11 million individuals. The Virginia-based firm said at the time that it had not yet determined the exact number of individuals affected. The scale of this incident is closely followed by the compromise of the French government’s unemployment agency, Pôle emploi, which recently confirmed a breach impacting the personal data of up to 10 million people. This makes the French agency the second-largest known victim of the mass-hack. Rounding out the top five MOVEit victims list is the Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles (6 million). Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (4 million) and the Oregon Department of Transportation (3.5 million). About one-third of hosts running vulnerable MOVEit servers at the time the mass-hacks began belonged to financial service-related organizations, according to security analysis firm Censys. The report, which analyzed 1,400 MOVEit servers that were openly accessible on the internet, found that 15.96% of hosts were associated with the healthcare sector, 8.92% were linked to information technology organizations and 7.5% were attributed to government and military entities. This is the estimated total cost of the MOVEit mass-hacks so far. The number is based on IBM data, which found the average data breach last year cost $165, coupled with the number of individuals confirmed to have been impacted. However, as noted by Emsisoft, only a handful of corporate victims have so far reported the number of individuals known to be affected. Emsisoft said that if the number was scaled, the cost would be at least $65 billion to date. Researchers believe that Clop may have been sitting on its MOVEit exploit as far back as 2021. U.S. risk consulting firm Kroll said in a report that while news of the vulnerability first emerged in late May, Kroll researchers identified activity indicating that Clop had been experimenting with exploiting this vulnerability for almost two years. “It appears that the Clop threat actors had the MOVEit Transfer exploit completed at the time of the GoAnywhere event and chose to execute the attacks sequentially instead of in parallel,” Kroll states. The U.S. State Department offered a $10 million bounty related to information on the Clop ransomware group after records from a number of department’s entities were compromised in the MOVEit breach. The Department of Energy confirmed to TechCrunch that two of its entities were among those breached. This is how much money Clop could earn from the MOVEit mass-hacking campaign, according to ransomware recovery company Coveware, with that sum derived from just a small handful of victims who gave into the hackers’ demands and paid significant ransom payments. “This is a dangerous and staggering sum of money for one, relatively small group to possess. For context, this amount is larger than the annual offensive security budget of Canada,” said Coveware. This is the amount of government data that Clop claims to hold on government, city or police services. In a post on its dark web leak site, the gang said it would “do the polite thing” and delete all government-related data. Clop has not provided evidence for this claim, nor has TechCrunch been able to verify its claim. “We are only financial [sic] motivated,” the hackers wrote."
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/polestar-4-to-feature-mobileyes-hands-off-eyes-off-driving-tech/,TechCrunch,"Polestar 4 to feature Mobileye’s hands-off, eyes-off driving tech","Swedish electric vehicle maker Polestar wants to bring Mobileye’s Chauffeur, a hands-off, eyes-off autonomous driving technology, to its Polestar 4 electric SUV coupe. The Polestar 4, which launched Friday in China and will hit global markets in 2024, comes standard with Mobileye’s SuperVision advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). Polestar plans to add Chauffeur at a later date, but did not specify when. SuperVision is a camera-based system that runs on Mobileye’s EyeQ5 chips. It includes highway automated driving features like autonomous lane changing, highway and traffic jam assist, evasive maneuver assist, front and rear collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control. Porsche in May also tapped Mobileye to integrate SuperVision into future EVs. Chauffeur builds on the SuperVision tech by adding a layer of radar and lidar sensors, and will run on Mobileye’s EyeQ6 chips. When Chauffeur officially launches, it’ll offer “point-to-point autonomous driving on highways, as well as eyes-on automated driving for other environments, in identified operational design domains,” according to Mobileye. “Other environments” can mean arterial roads, freeways, rural or urban streets. Mobileye says expansion to new operational design domains (ODDs) will depend on the sensor and compute power chosen by each OEM — Chauffeur won’t work without lidar integration. The combination of lidar, radar and cameras allow cars equipped with Mobileye technology to continuously map a region to ensure accurate coverage and extensive online and offline validation. “Whether the ODD comes online city by city or an entire broader area at once depends on our customer choices,” Justin Hyde, director of Mobileye’s corporate communications, told TechCrunch. “And our system is designed to work day and night, without time restriction.” Polestar previously announced that its Polestar 4 will include an in-cabin camera-based driver monitoring system (DMS) to ensure the driver doesn’t overly rely on SuperVision or fall asleep at the wheel. The company has not yet confirmed if it will add onto that DMS once it integrates Chauffeur. More details about the Chauffeur integration will come closer to launch, like how much either the system itself or the Polestar 4 equipped with lidar will cost. Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” software, which features automated driving capabilities on highways and urban streets, relies only on cameras and costs $15,000."
2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/qase-raises-7-2m-to-help-companies-manage-their-software-tests/,TechCrunch,Qase raises $7.2M to help companies manage their software tests,"Qase, an Austin-based platform for managing software quality assurance testing and reporting, today announced that it raised $7.2 million in a Series A round led by Chrome Capital with participation from FinSight Ventures and S16VC. Nikita Fedorov, the CEO and founder, says that the proceeds will be put mostly toward product development, including a plug-ins marketplace, and expanding Qase’s 33-person workforce to 50 by the end of the year. “This expansion will enable us to accelerate our R&D and better serve our increasing user base,” Fedorov told TechCrunch in an email interview. “It’ll ensure that our platform remains at the forefront of innovation, meeting the evolving needs of our users.” Fedorov, who got his start in software engineering as a PHP developer, was inspired to launch Qase after working as the head of billing and payment systems for Avito, a classified ads site. While there, he faced a niggling problem: he couldn’t find a test management system that wasn’t solely focused on manual, as opposed to automated, testing. “The software testing tools market faces significant challenges, including a crowded and fragmented landscape,” Fedorov said. “Companies often rely on multiple tools, ranging from ten to 40, for their daily testing needs — which can lead to inefficiency. Moreover, the industry struggles with a low ratio of test automation, indicating an ongoing dependence on manual testing.” Indeed, companies often struggle to find the right set of tools to execute their software testing strategy. In a recent survey from Kobiton, an app testing platform, 26% of organizations said that finding tools for test automation was the biggest challenge they faced. The cost of bugs is enormous, though — adding to the pressure on companies to find testing tooling. One report suggests that 26% of the average developer’s time is spent reproducing and fixing failing tests, which equates to 620 million developer hours a year. That’s not to mention, of course, the effects on a company’s reputation when serious bugs slip into the wild. Over the course of two years while working at Avito, Fedorov built an MVP for Qase. In 2018, he launched it in early access, and in 2020, he quit his day job to work on Qase full time. According to Fedorov, Qase was built around three core pillars: test management, test reporting and test analytics. Intended to serve as a single platform for manual and automated testing, Qase, which integrates with a number of popular software testing frameworks and supports third-party tests, can collect test execution results for manual and automated testing — providing analytics throughout the process. Wait, you might ask — aren’t there plenty of software testing suites out there? Well… yes. There’s ProdPerfect, which focuses on automated web app testing, and SpotQA, an automated software testing platform that claims to be significantly faster than its competitors. There’s also Virtuoso, a startup that uses machine learning to identify software bugs and errors. Qase’s automated and manual test reporting dashboard. Image Credits: Qase But Fedorov claims that Qase’s advantage lies in its “comprehensive organizational view,” a feature that encourages a more holistic approach to software testing. Within Qase, testing reports and dashboards can be shared among teams. And Qase syncs tests not only with ticket trackers but other testing frameworks and CI/CD tools, organizing the results by severity and priority. “Qase’s technology holds immense significance for data and technical decision makers, particularly at the C-suite level,” Fedorov added. “As an integral part of the software development lifecycle, software testing plays a key role in reducing time-to-market. This efficiency optimization directly affects the bottom line, making it a top priority for enterprise organizations seeking a competitive edge.” It sounds a little like marketing jargon to this writer. But Qase has had impressive uptake, to be sure — managing to bring its annual recurring revenue to $2 million within three years. In the last six months alone, Qase has identified over a million bugs for 100,000 users and enterprise customers including Asana, SeatGeek and DoorDash-owned Wolt. “We’re focused on maintaining a sustainable financial foundation. Our operating cash flow results demonstrate a stable financial position,” Fedorov said. “While the tech industry has experienced a slowdown over the past year, we’re positioned to navigate potential headwinds by transitioning to a ‘pay-per-usage’ business model. This strategic shift, coupled with our value-driven approach, ensures that customers pay for the actual benefits they receive.”"

The promise? Make opening a bank account, storing money, receiving a payment card and lending money as easy as opening a social network account. The reinvention of banking is well underway, and we’re excited to welcome three key players — Peter Hazlehurst, co-founder and CEO, Synctera; Laura Spiekerman, co-founder and president, Alloy; and Amanda Swoverland, chief compliance officer, Unit — to the Fintech Stage on September 19 at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023. In a session called “Making Money Move with Embedded Finance,” our panel will talk about how a new breed of finance infrastructure companies have the potential to turn any company into a fintech company. Despite a roller-coaster year that featured mergers, acquisitions and layoffs, the BaaS sector is huge and expected to be worth almost $66 billion by 2030. Venture dollars continue to flow. This past March, Synctera raised $15 million to launch embedded products in Canada. In May 2022, Unit closed a $100 million round with a $1.2 billion valuation, and in September, Alloy raised $52 million at a $1.55 billion valuation — just 11 months after raising $100 million at a $1.35 billion valuation. With millions of dollars in funding — and billions of dollars in market potential — flying around, we’re eager to hear our panelists’ take on how a new wave of finance infrastructure startups are reinventing the way financial services are created, distributed and sold. Learn more about our speakers — and their qualifications for tackling this timely topic — below. Peter Hazlehurst is a global fintech entrepreneur and philanthropist with nearly 30 years of experience creating financial products for banks, fintechs and large tech companies.

2023-08-25,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/orbital-composites-lands-new-government-contracts-to-advance-in-space-manufacturing/,TechCrunch,Orbital Composites lands new government contracts to advance in-space manufacturing,"Advanced manufacturing startup Orbital Composites is expanding its in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing development work with three new Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts valued at more than $3 million combined. One contract, for the U.S. Space Force (USSF), is focused on developing a new type of antenna based on an emerging field called “quantum field theory,” that has promising applications for defense customers and in the energy sector. The second, also for the USSF, is looking at developing and printing low-cost CubeSats engineered to withstand harsh radiation environments, such as in geosynchronous orbit (GEO). The final SBIR, with the Air Force, is focused on developing composite printing techniques using an advanced material called “carbon-carbon.” The three SBIRs reflect Orbital Composite’s deepening commitment to the space industry, to which CEO Amolak Badesha said the company had taken an “unconventional path.” Founded in 2015, Orbital Composites was built on the premise that you could innovate additive manufacturing techniques to print the most advanced products possible. To that end, the company makes robotic printing systems that print composites at varying scales: all the way from the very small and intricate up to the very large. The company’s manufacturing techniques could be used for industries ranging from space to energy or climate, Badesha explained. “We’re not dependent on just one market,” he said. “The same materials that are used for reentry vehicles or even for hypersonics, those same materials are used in hydrogen propulsion or even normal commercial aircraft.” Over time, the company started thinking not just about printing materials for space — but printing them in space, too. The company has a three-step plan, Badesha said. The first step is making everything on Earth and launching it to space. Step two is printing products, like antenna tiles, on the ground and assembling them in space. “We can start making 15-, 20-meter antennas like that,” he said, at a dramatically reduced cost. The third step is doing everything in space: printing and assembly. Skipping terrestrial printing and launch would be a huge cost saver over the long run. Badesha pointed out that antennas are among the biggest points of failure for satellites in GEO. The recent issues with ViaSat’s ViaSat-3 Americas satellite antenna are a case in point: If the company has to claim the mission as a loss, it would be a $700 million failure. In the future, Orbital Composites could have a business either servicing these ultra-expensive antennae or replacing them altogether. The SBIRs are related to this larger plan. The SBIR contract focused on quantum field antennas is looking at building massive antennas in space — up to kilometer-scale in the case of space-based solar power applications, Badesha said. “The only way to do that is ISAM — in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing,” he said. Last month, Orbital Composites was also awarded a $1.7 million contract from the USSF to work with partners Axiom Space, Northrop Grumman and the Southwest Research Institute to explore 3D printing massive antennas in space. Eventually, the aim is to establish an in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing lab outside Axiom’s private space station later this decade."

2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/this-venture-backed-startup-has-quietly-bought-more-than-80-mom-and-pop-shops/,TechCrunch,This venture-backed startup has quietly bought more than 80 mom-and-pop shops,"Teamshares is a low-flying, New York-based startup with big ambitions to capitalize on an opportunity in plain sight: that of small businesses without a succession plan. It’s not a small market. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small businesses represent 99.7% of U.S. employer firms and 64% of private-sector jobs. Meanwhile, just 15% or so of small business owners pass along their company to a family member, with many others simply closing up shop at some point. With an aging population in the U.S., Teamshares is betting this market will grow even bigger, which is why since 2018, it has snapped up 84 small businesses from retiring owners. These owners like its pitch. Though Teamshares says that it sometimes pays below market price for a company, it installs a new president that it trains and grants 10% of the business’s stock to its employees. Moreover, it promises to increase those employees’ ownership to 80% within 20 years. It sounds almost valiant, like when KKR bought out a door company in 2015 and promised every employee a payout of at least $15,000 if the company met its targets when sold. When in 2022, KKR sold the company for 10 times what it paid, its 800 employees saw a payout of $360 million. But Teamshares isn’t in the private equity business. It’s a fintech company that has raised $245 million in venture capital to date, including from QED Investors, Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures, Inspired Capital, Khosla Ventures and Slow Ventures. It has also secured another $150 million in debt. Those backers aren’t funding Teamshares so that it can grow and resell the businesses it acquires. In fact, according to co-founder and CEO Michael Brown, Teamshares doesn’t want to sell the companies it is buying — ever. The plan instead is to generate revenue from a growing array of fintech products that it sells to the businesses it buys. Think insurance, think credit cards. If everything goes as planned, Teamshares will eventually replace the majority of vendors these companies use — and become a brand known to many others outside of its immediate sphere. Certainly, it’s among the more unique fintech models this reporter can recall. More below, edited for length. TC: Other than some exceptions like KKR, which is focused in part on employee ownership because owners tend to be better employees, I don’t know of another venture-backed company doing what you’re doing. How did you settle on this broader idea? MB:  I spent the first seven years of my career in investment banking. And that’s where I met Alex Eu and Kevin Shiiba, the other two founders. Kevin decided he wanted to join the tech industry very early [and joined the] coding bootcamp General Assembly; Alex and I went and bought one, and then eventually eight, small businesses. We transitioned from being financial spreadsheet people to being operators and later entrepreneurs; learning how to operate a businesses informs [our work] today. How did you exit those businesses? We still own the ones in Canada; they’re running themselves today. There’s a president, a vice president. They’re just sort of like a dormant legacy business, but they’ve started the employee ownership journey, too, and that’s continuing on. You make money off those businesses through dividends? Is this how you’ll make money at Teamshares? How Teamshares makes money is we buy businesses, we dilute ourselves voluntarily to get employee ownership jump-started. We [carve out] 10% for all the employees and an additional 5% for [a president who we hire to run each business], and that stock is a gift — it’s earned over time through service. From a financial standpoint, we’re [structured] just like Berkshire Hathaway, so if we buy a business with $5 million in revenue, then that becomes our revenue the next day. We profit from the profits of the business that was acquired, proportionate to our ownership, and we sell our stock back over time to the companies until it becomes 80% employee owned. We also have new revenue streams that we’ve just started launching. We built a neobank, we’re soon to launch credit cards, and we’re building an insurance business as well, so there’s a secondary layer of financial products that will basically replace the vendors that the companies used to use. These products are going to be available exclusively to Teamshares companies or you start there and expand out? The hope is the latter. We only build something if a product doesn’t exist for our exact use case, which is some combination of really traditional small business or employee ownership. And there’s not a lot of stuff [out there]. When we set out, we didn’t think we’d build a neobank, but there just wasn’t something that existed to our satisfaction, in part because small businesses still unfortunately receive a lot of checks. But the hope would be that in the future — let’s call it in the next five years — we could scale up and open these products up and have small businesses generally get to know Teamshares. What do the companies you’ve acquired so far have in common? Where we have commonality in the companies is around employee ownership, financial education, the president program and financial infrastructure. So, we’re audited by KPMG, for example, and we help these companies go from mom-and-pop accounting to having real financial infrastructure and being able to produce statement financials every month that are in accordance with GAAP. But we really believe in the companies [operating as] independently as possible. We provide support, and we work closely with the presidents. But we don’t think that it’s a good idea to try and integrate all the companies. So you aren’t trying to roll up similar companies, or swaths of similar companies? There are some exceptions where, for example, we’ve been buying pizza shops in a state back East, and those are being integrated to create one larger company that’s going to create more employee ownership wealth than could a stand-alone set of pizza shops. We’re doing this again in pool maintenance, where a lot of the businesses are really [small] and actually [buying] a first one that’s small but big enough to support the cost of a president, and then you can add smaller ones. So there’s a roll-up-esque element of certain companies we work with, but in general, we think these are really high-quality businesses that can operate fairly independently and we actually make a very devout customer promise that the companies are going to become 80% employee owned, or never for sale again. What’s your investing criteria? There are over 40 specific industries [represented in Teamshares’ current portfolio], but they really fall into about six categories, which are business services, consumer services, distribution, manufacturing, restaurants, and retail. So they’re all traditional businesses that are, on average, 30 years old, with annual revenue of between $2 million and $10 million generally. We have a belief that employee ownership works in every industry, and our actual final decision — amongst the 70,000 leads we get every year — is all done on a case-by-case basis. But we start off by filtering the companies on what we call our structural criteria. So is it a true retirement sale? Are the owners of that age? Are there two or more managers? Is there low customer concentration? Do the earnings show up on the tax returns? You’re planning to sell these companies your products. Are there other ways the companies in the Teamshares ecosystem can work together? Absolutely. We’re now getting to the size where we’re starting to organize the companies, around industry groups. So there’s talk of the restaurant companies all kind of banding together [toward the goal of] common purchasing. The presidents [sometimes] share knowledge about what’s the best sort of ERP system and other software to use? Then there’s other things that don’t make sense for us to build but we can arrange large, corporate vendor partnerships. So, for example, you know, lots of these companies need vehicles, so having a national account with one of the major vehicle lessors is going to make sense. You mentioned Berkshire Hathaway early on. Is that what you aspire to build? Do you want Teamshares to go public? The most probable outcome is we go public, but there are ways to stay private, too. We do not plan to ever sell Teamshares; we would want it to be independent. In terms of the Berkshire Hathaway piece, we subscribe to a lot of their philosophy about being very long-term minded and being pretty efficient in our underwriting and keeping things simple. But we’re not a one-for-one translation of the model. Their model is to have the permanent ownership forever, whereas our model has employee ownership as a twist, so we’re actually forgoing some amount of future growth by making employee ownership happen. And we believe that’s the right thing to do. And we believe the companies will be bigger and better for it. Also Berkshire Hathaway can only buy companies that already have a CEO in place, whereas that’s not a luxury you can have in small business. We realized we had to build up a new generation of people, generally in their 30s and 40s, who were ready for something more entrepreneurial and ready for something really mission aligned. And so we recruit people from some really great companies — McKinsey, USAA, Tesla and Amazon — and train them to run these small businesses. How many employees do you have, and how big is your tech team? We have about 140 people altogether, and a 70-person tech team, so we’ve closed seven companies a month with two people. We’ve created a lot of leverage through building a lot of software for ourselves and for the companies."
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/former-president-trump-returns-to-twitter-now-x-with-his-mugshot/,TechCrunch,"Former president Trump returns to Twitter, now X, with his mugshot","Former president Trump tweeted for the first time in more than two years on Thursday night, breaking a long silence on the platform, now known as X, that persisted into Elon Musk’s chaotic takeover. Trump’s first tweet since January 8, 2021, came after he was booked in an Atlanta jail on Thursday for 13 felony charges related to election interference in the state of Georgia. The former president, who is seeking reelection in 2024, tweeted shortly after his mugshot went public, an unusual and historic moment that continues to reverberate on social media. In the tweet, the former president directed on his more than 86 million followers on X to his WinRed fundraising page. “Today, at the notoriously violent jail in Fulton County, Georgia, I was ARRESTED despite having committed NO CRIME,” the fundraiser reads. “If you can, please make a contribution to evict Crooked Joe Biden from the White House and SAVE AMERICA during this dark chapter in our nation’s history.” Trump paired the call to action with the words “ELECTION INTERFERENCE, NEVER SURRENDER!” and his own mugshot, which had already spread like wildfire on Thursday night, inspiring a deluge of memes in the process. Musk, a day after promoting Trump’s interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, retweeted Trump with the words “Next-level.” Trump posted the same message to his 6 million followers on Truth Social, the alternative social platform that he launched in 2022. While Trump was initially given a lifetime ban from Twitter for inciting violence during the January 6 Capitol attack, Elon Musk overturned the ban — and many others — in the course of dismantling many of the platform’s longstanding moderation policies and safety practices. The moment that Trump chose to return to X, mugshot in tow, offers at least a few layers of situational irony. For one, Trump was obviously booted off the platform to begin with for activity related to the charges he faces in the Georgia election meddling case. But beyond the Georgia case, Trump faces looming federal charges stemming from an investigation by Special Counsel Jack Smith, who cited the former president’s tweets widely in an indictment revealed earlier this month."
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/reddit-mod-helper-program-update-moderation-protest/,TechCrunch,Reddit launches moderator rewards program amid site-wide discontent ,"Reddit is launching the “Mod Helper Program” to reward moderators who offer helpful advice to other moderators, along with an updated moderator help center. The announcement comes amid growing discontent among the site’s moderators, many of whom relied on third-party apps that have since been shut down because of Reddit’s API pricing. Moderators have asked Reddit to improve the official app’s moderation tools, which are lacking compared to those offered by now-defunct third-party apps. Tensions between Reddit and its moderators are still high, as the site’s admins continue to remove entire mod teams for keeping their subreddits private in protest of the API pricing, which third-party app developers criticized as exorbitant and unsustainable. The Mod Helper Program is a tiered system that awards helpful moderators with trophies and flairs. Reddit users accrue karma by receiving upvotes and awards, and lose karma if they receive downvotes. The program rewards moderators who receive upvotes on comments in r/ModSupport. Comment karma earned in r/ModSupport will be rewarded with trophies that will “signal to other mods that you are a source of valuable information,” the moderator support team announced on Thursday. Each rank awards unique trophies and flairs, ranging from “Helper” to “Expert Helper.” Reddit launched a similar program in r/help earlier this year, which rewards users who accrue karma by responding to other users’ requests. “Reddit can be a complex place for newbie and expert Mods alike, and the knowledge that you share with each other here is incredibly powerful,” Reddit admins wrote in r/ModSupport. “This will both recognize Mods who are particularly helpful and reliable sources of knowledge for their fellow Mods, all with the goal of celebrating your support of each other and fostering a culture in this community where mods readily collaborate and learn from one another.” Reddit also launched the Modmail Answer Bot, which automatically responds with relevant links to the site’s Help Center. If the recommended articles don’t answer a specific request, it will create a ticket that will be handled by a human admin. The bot is designed to streamline moderator requests so the admin team can focus on more complex issues. Additionally, Reddit is merging the moderator-specific Help Center with its sitewide one to ensure that support resources are “easy to find and accessible from the same location.” The relationship between Reddit and its moderators has become increasingly strained in recent months. Over 8,000 subreddits shut down for 48 hours in June in protest of Reddit’s new API pricing, which went into effect on July 1. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman claimed that the blackout was led by a minority of moderators, describing them “landed gentry.” The comment sparked further outrage among moderators, who spend hours running the platform’s communities without pay. In recent months, Reddit has ramped up its efforts to smother the rebellion by removing moderators who refuse to reopen their subreddits. Once-thriving subreddits like r/malefashionadvice are crumbling as Reddit replaces protesting moderators with inexperienced users. Reddit has been slow to roll out moderation tools that were once offered by third-party apps, and the updates that the site has launched are clumsy and inaccessible. Though Reddit made an exception to its API pricing for accessibility apps, which are crucial for blind users, its in-app moderation tools aren’t accessible for blind moderators. Reddit’s most recent accessibility update was riddled with bugs and “introduced a pile of new issues,” according to a moderator of r/blind. The response to the peer-to-peer helper program was mixed in r/ModSupport. One user questioned whether automating the support request system would only make it harder to receive help from a “real person.” They also noted that the subreddit exists for moderators to discuss issues directly with admins, not with other moderators. “Admin participation hasn’t been great here,” the user continued. “I don’t know if that’s because you guys aren’t familiar enough with mod tools to provide meaningful support to the mod community, or if you just can’t be bothered. But you seem to mostly rely on the mod community to address questions and concerns here, and that’s not what people come here for.” In the most upvoted comment replying to the announcement, Reddit user MapleSurpy expressed frustration over the lack of useful moderation features available on Reddit’s official app. Moderators have requested ban evasion tools and “actual help from admins” when dealing with “problem users,” MapleSurpy said. “We’ve asked for better tools on the official app to run subs now that Reddit took away every single third-party one,” they said. “What did we get? Another automated system . . . and flair rewards. Thank you SO much, I’m sure this will solve a whopping zero problems.” Another user pointed out that the flairs aren’t based on comments that are actually helpful and that “snarky people who are funny” will reach “expert in no time.” In a reply to the thread, an admin said that Reddit’s product teams are working on “some of the issues” that moderators have brought up and will be launching improvements to mobile features. “Our team isn’t engineers — so you don’t want us building you things, however — we do spend our time talking to moderators about the issues you’re facing and advocating back to the product teams,” the admin, who is part of the moderator support team, said. “Automating some of the lower-hanging fruit allows us to spend more time both helping with the more complicated issues and compiling concerns from mods to help prioritize the tools being built.”"
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/nvidia-earnings-flying-high/,TechCrunch,Nvidia is flying high thanks to AI,"When Nvidia announced eye-popping earnings on Wednesday with three-digit year-over-year growth, it was easy to get caught up in the excitement. The company brought in $13.5 billion for the quarter, up 101% over the prior year, and well over its $11 billion guidance. That’s certainly something to get excited about. Nvidia is benefiting from being a company in the right place at the right time, where its GPU chips are in high demand to run large language models and other AI-fueled workloads. That in turn is driving Nvidia’s astonishing growth this quarter. (It’s worth noting that the company set the groundwork for its current success some time ago.) “​​Data center compute revenue nearly tripled year on year, driven primarily by accelerating demand for cloud from cloud service providers and large consumer internet companies for our HGX platform, the engine of generative and large language models,” Colette Kress, Nvidia’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, said in the post-earnings report call with analysts. This kind of growth brings to mind the heady days of cloud stocks, some of which soared during the pandemic lockdown as companies accelerated their usage of SaaS to keep their workers connected. Zoom, in particular, took off with five quarters of absolutely astonishing growth during that time. Zoom’s pandemic fueled growth. Image Credits: TechCrunch Today, even double-digit growth is long gone. For its most recent report earlier this month, Zoom reported revenue of $1.138 billion, up 3.6% over the prior year. That follows five straight quarters of single-digit growth, the last three in the low single digits. Could Zoom possibly be a cautionary tale for a company like Nvidia riding the generative AI wave? And perhaps more importantly, will this drive unreasonable investor expectations about future performance as it did with Zoom? It’s interesting to note that Nvidia’s biggest growth area is in the data center and that web scalers are still building at a rapid pace with plans to add over 300 new data centers in the coming years, per a Synergy Research report from March 2022. “The future looks bright for hyperscale operators, with double-digit annual growth in total revenues supported in large part by cloud revenues that will be growing in the 20–30% per year range. This in turn will drive strong growth in capex generally and in data center spending specifically,” said John Dinsdale, a chief analyst at Synergy Research Group, in a statement about the report. At least some percentage of this spending will surely be devoted to resources for running AI workloads, and Nvidia should benefit from that, CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on Wednesday. In fact, he believes that his company’s expansive growth is much more than a flash in the pan. “There’s about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it, a quarter of a trillion dollars of capital spend each year. You’re seeing that data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today: accelerated computing and generative AI,” Huang said. “And so I think this is not a near-term thing. This is a long-term industry transition, and we’re seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time.” If he’s right, perhaps the company can sustain this level of growth, but history suggests that what goes up must eventually come down. If Zoom is any indication, some businesses that see rapid growth for one reason or another can hold on to that revenue in the future. While it’s certainly less exciting for investors that Zoom’s growth rate has sharply moderated in recent quarters, it’s also true that Zoom has continued to grow. That means it has retained all its prior scale and then some. "
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/you-can-finally-buy-legos-braille-bricks/,TechCrunch,You can finally buy Lego’s Braille Bricks,"Building with Lego bricks has stayed a formative and important practice for kids around the world, partly because it’s so easily enjoyed by anyone, regardless of location, language, or ability. Now the company has made its Braille Bricks, a learning toy for children with visual impairments (or who just want to learn the script) available for purchase by anyone who wants them. The set was introduced back in 2019, but only as a kit that was distributed for free to limited recipients, like people and organizations specializing in teaching kids with vision impairments. After a couple years of feedback, Lego has decided to make the set widely available. It’s a 287-piece box of special bricks, most of which are of the standard 2×4 variety, which allows room for each letter of the 2×3-dot Braille alphabet and a visible label. This allows them to be teaching tools for sighted and vision-impaired; there’s also a reference sheet with the letters and bricks in order, and a set of starter projects to get things moving. “For the blind community, braille is not just literacy, it’s our entry to independence and inclusion into this world, and to have LEGO Braille Bricks made available for the wider public is a massive step forward to ensuring more children will want to learn braille in the first place,” said Martine Abel-Williamson, president of the World Blind Union, in Lego’s announcement of the set’s availability. Image Credits: Lego The set is part of a gradual progression of expanding specialized Braille learning tools from schools to homes. There is also, for instance, a new push to make refreshable Braille displays available and affordable, which would enable e-reader-like functionality as well as composition capabilities. Accessibility is being baked into more digital products as well, though there are still countless challenges in making sure people with disabilities can interact intuitively with some of the more complex web apps and services. The Play with Braille Lego set will be shipped in early September but is available for preorder in English and French now for $90."

2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/advanced-ionics-hydrogen-series-a/,TechCrunch,Advanced Ionics nets $12.5M Series A to inject green hydrogen into heavy industry,"When people talk about hydrogen these days, they almost always mention transportation. I get it: People are used to filling up tanks, not charging cars. But from a practical perspective, transportation is not a great use for hydrogen. “Hydrogen is really terrible to store and to transport,” said Chad Mason, founder and CEO of Advanced Ionics. Which is why Advanced Ionics is a hydrogen company that has nothing to do with transportation. Instead, the startup is focused on heavy industry, which represents about a third of global emissions. “Hydrogen is one of the main feedstocks for a vast majority of industrial processes,” Mason told TechCrunch+. It’s essential for the ammonia used to make fertilizers and for many petrochemical processes used to make everything from plastics to synthetic rubber and lubricants. Even steel and glass production could benefit from a decarbonized source of hydrogen. Amid the crowd of hydrogen companies hoping to elbow their way into these markets, Advanced Ionics hopes its more efficient approach to using electrolysis will give it an unfair advantage in producing hydrogen. Today, much of the world’s hydrogen supply comes from what’s called steam-reformed methane. Basically, steam is mixed with methane gas, producing hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Electrolyzers, on the other hand, use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. If they’re powered by renewable energy, then the process can be carbon-free. But they’re not perfect. Most efforts to produce hydrogen work at either relatively low temperatures or high temperatures. Advanced Ionics’ electrolyzers, though, work at temperatures that are not too high or low, basically the same range at which many industrial processes already take place. That means the heat requirements for the startup’s equipment are the same as what’s already available at those sites. "
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/shein-inks-deal-with-forever-21-as-it-looks-to-boost-its-reach/,TechCrunch,Shein inks deal with Forever 21 as it looks to boost its reach,"Shein and Forever 21 have entered into a partnership that will give both brands new ways to reach customers, the retailers announced on Thursday. As part of the partnership, Shein will acquire around a third of Forever 21′s operator, Sparc Group. Sparc will also take a minority stake in Shein. The financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed. The agreement was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The partnership will allow Shein to sell Forever 21 clothing and accessories on its site. Shein says the partnership gives it the opportunity to test customer-focused experiences at Forever 21 locations across the United States, including shop-in-shops and in-store returns. With these new initiatives, the two retailers will be able to expand their reach. Although both Shein and Forever 21 are known for affordable fast fashion, they cater to customers in different ways. For instance, while Shein sells its items online, Forever 21 is known for its physical locations. By leveraging each other’s networks, the companies will be able reach customers in more ways. It’s worth noting that Shein has already experimented with in-store shopping, as the company has held limited-time pop-up shops in cities like New York City, Cincinnati and Los Angeles. “We are excited for the partnership with Shein as it reflects our shared vision of providing customers with unparalleled access to fashion at affordable prices,” said Sparc Group CEO Marc Miller in a statement. “By working together, we will provide even more innovative and trendsetting products to fashion enthusiasts around the world.” It’s worth noting that Sparc is a joint venture that includes Authentic Brands Group, a brand management company with a portfolio of notable names like Brooks Brothers, Lucky Brand and Nine West. Its portfolio also includes Simon Property Group, which is the biggest shopping mall owner in the United States. The partnership comes as Shein has faced criticism over the environmental impact of its fast-fashion practices. Congress has also pressed the company to certify to the SEC that its products that are made in China do not utilize forced Uyghur labor. Shein recently invited a select number of influencers to tour one of its factories in Guangzhou, China, to portray a scene that was the opposite of the brand’s long-running allegations. Shein’s vision for the trip backfired, as users saw that it was a highly curated brand trip where influencers were offered free travel opportunities and gifts, encouraging them to promote a favorable image of the company. Despite the environmental and labor concerns, Shein is extremely popular on apps like TikTok, YouTube and Instagram, where people and creators show off all the clothes they got at cheap prices. Shein has tried to distance itself from China, as U.S. lawmakers continue to scrutinize companies with ties to the Asian country, including TikTok. To distance itself from the country, Shein moved its headquarters in 2021 to Singapore. The company also does not sell its products in China, despite being founded there in 2012."

2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/meta-is-shutting-down-messenger-lite-for-android-in-september/,TechCrunch,Meta is shutting down Messenger Lite for Android in September,"Meta is shutting down Messenger Lite, its lightweight stripped-down version of Messenger, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Users of the app are starting to see a message that advises them to “use Messenger to keep chatting.” The app has been removed from the Google Play Store for new users and will no longer be available after September 18 for current users. “Starting August 21, people using the Messenger Lite app for Android will be directed to Messenger or FB Lite to send and receive messages on Messenger,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email. Meta, known as Facebook at the time, introduced Messenger Lite for Android in 2016 for users with less-powerful Android devices. The app offers only the core features Messenger in order to hog less storage space and processing power. Although Meta launched Messenger Lite for iOS, the company shut it down in 2020. According to mobile analytics firm data.ai, the Lite versions of the app had combined downloads estimated at approximately 760 million globally, with India accounting for the single largest portion, followed by Brazil and Indonesia. The United States ranked No. 8 by lifetime downloads. The news comes as Meta recently announced that Messenger is dropping SMS support next month. The company notified users that they “will no longer be able to use Messenger to send and receive SMS messages sent by your cellular network when you update your app after September 28, 2023.” Earlier this week, Meta said it plans to enable end-to-end encryption by default for Messenger by the end of this year. The tech giant is also expanding its test of end-to-end encryption features to “millions more people’s chats.”"
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/no-mans-sky-updates-are-going-strong-with-starfield-around-the-corner/,TechCrunch,No Man’s Sky updates are going strong with Starfield around the corner,"With a big-budget space exploration game debuting in days, indie spacefaring mainstay No Man’s Sky continues to deepen its own world with no signs of slowing down. No Man’s Sky is one of gaming’s biggest unlikely success stories: After launching as a widespread letdown, the team at Hello Games dedicated themselves to steadily enriching the game’s interstellar setting with free updates over the course of the last seven years. The game’s latest infusion of fresh content is called Echoes and introduces a new robotic alien civilization for anthropologically-inclined players to study, among many other updates. The new alien race apparently adds a chain of missions packed with hours of narrative questing as the player explores where these scrap metal-lookin’ guys came from and what they’re all about. That includes new cloaked encampments on inhabited worlds, secret monolith-powered visions and a fresh lexicon to uncover. If you’re less into archaeology and more about blowing stuff up in space (understandable), the Echoes update incentivizes the pirate in you by making freighters destructible. The game’s hulking dreadnought freighters now include an ominous, aggressive pirate variant and new trenches you can fly through, Death Star-style. Freighter combat also improves with more detailed module-based targeting to make dogfights in space more interesting and tactical. If you prefer a Pokémon-like playstyle, No Man’s Sky’s Echoes update introduces a new set of collector’s objectives known as the Voyagers Expedition, which will reward you for finding the nicest planets, highest mountains and weirdest critters. You can showcase the stuff you like in your base with a new projector that makes your HQ on a far-flung planet that much cozier.  With Echoes, anyone playing No Man’s Sky with PlayStation VR will benefit from a new visual update that improves detail and resolution using eye-tracking that sharpens the center of your field of vision. Nintendo Switch No Man’s Sky players will also see a visual boost on the relatively underpowered hardware thanks to new improvements leveraging AMD FidelityFX that will boost framerates and image quality. Somehow, there’s even more stuff in the latest No Man’s Sky update than listed here. It’s shocking how much care developer Hello Games puts into a relatively ancient game with these ongoing free infusions of new content. The Echoes update isn’t even the only one this year — April’s Interceptor update and the Fractal expansion in February also made a bunch of improvements while bringing more variety to the procedurally-generated space game. It’s an interesting time for No Man’s Sky. Over the course of many years and many updates, the Hello Games team delivered a dream game for anyone who just wanted to fly around in an infinite universe and check things out. Personally, I played the game for the first few years after it started improving and my biggest complaint at the time — that No Man’s Sky’s universe was endless but didn’t offer enough rewarding variety — has been addressed and then some. It’s admirable that the game’s team has supported the No Man’s Sky community for so long and done so without relying on gimmicky seasons or selling virtual items. With Bethesda’s blockbuster space exploration game Starfield out on September 6, No Man’s Sky players are sure to be curious about the big-budget space sim, which promises at least 1,000 planets to explore. Lapsed No Man’s Sky players like myself are plenty curious too, assuming we can peel ourselves away from Baldur’s Gate 3 long enough to check it out. Even if Starfield fully delivers on its promises, anyone who’s spent time in No Man’s Sky can appreciate its colorful take on limitless space exploration and the wonder it continues to inspire, now seven years after the fact."
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/astropads-latest-is-a-combo-ipad-screen-protect-apple-pencil-tip/,TechCrunch,Astropad’s latest is a combo iPad screen protector/Apple Pencil Tip,"One thing you can definitely say about Astropad: they didn’t let a good old-fashioned Sherlocking keep them down. Over the years, new Apple features have scorched the earth of many a startup, and while the introduction of Sidecar for macOS certainly knocked the company for a loop, they learned an important lesson about diversifying. Initially, that meant leveraging the Luna Display technology on a variety of different platforms, while adding some innovative use cases, like teleprompter functionality. More recently, Astropad has gotten into the iPad accessories game — no lasting hard feelings against Apple here, I guess. In June, the firm released Darkboard, a $120 drawing pad for the Apple tablet. Image Credits: Astropad Today it adds Rock, Paper, Pencil to the list. A combo iPad screen protector and Apple pencil tip seems like an odd pairing, but it makes sense. Putting a layer between your screen and stylus doesn’t always have the best result. Astropad is also claiming the two offerings “create the most realistic pen-on-paper feeling for iPad.” That’s courtesy of a micro textured matte finish on the screen protector and a metal ballpoint-style tip on the stylus. The tip screws onto the Pencil like Apple’s proprietary model, while the screen protector snaps on magnetically. The latter bit means it’s not a permanent addition.

2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/data-scraping-privacy-risks-joint-statement/,TechCrunch,Social media giants urged to tackle data-scraping privacy risks,"A joint statement signed by regulators at a dozen international privacy watchdogs, including the U.K.’s ICO, Canada’s OPC and Hong Kong’s OPCPD, has urged mainstream social media platforms to protect users’ public posts from scraping — warning they face a legal responsibility to do so in most markets. “In most jurisdictions, personal information that is ‘publicly available’, ‘publicly accessible’ or ‘of a public nature’ on the internet, is subject to data protection and privacy laws,” they write. “Individuals and companies that scrape such personal information are therefore responsible for ensuring that they comply with these and other applicable laws. However, social media companies and the operators of other websites that host publicly accessible personal information (SMCs and other websites) also have data protection obligations with respect to third-party scraping from their sites. These obligations will generally apply to personal information whether that information is publicly accessible or not. Mass data scraping of personal information can constitute a reportable data breach in many jurisdictions.” The timing of the statement, which was also signed by privacy regulators in Australia, Switzerland, Norway, New Zealand, Colombia, Jersey, Morocco, Argentina and Mexico — who are all members of the Global Privacy Assembly’s international enforcement cooperation working group — coincides with the ongoing hype around generative AI models which typically require large amounts of data for training and could encourage more entities to scrape the Internet in a bid to acquire data-sets jump on the generative AI bandwagon. High profile examples of such systems, such as OpenAI’s large language model ChatGPT, have relied (at least in part) upon data posted online for training their systems — and a class action lawsuit filed against the U.S. company in June, which CNN Business reported on, alleges it secretly scraped “massive amounts of personal data from the internet”. Among the privacy risks the regulators highlight is the use of data scraping for targeted cyberattacks such as social engineering and phishing; identity fraud; and for the monitoring, profiling and surveilling of individuals, such as using data to populate facial recognition databases and provide unauthorised access to authorities — a clear swipe at Clearview AI, which has faced a number of enforcements from international regulators (including several across the EU) over its use of scraped data to power a facial recognition ID tool which it sold to law enforcement and other users. They also warn scraped data can be used for unauthorised political or intelligence gathering purposes — including by foreign governments or intelligence agencies. And be used to pump out unwanted direct marketing or spam. They don’t directly cite the training of AI models as one of these “key” privacy risks but generative AI tools which have been trained on people’s data without their knowledge or consent could be repurposed for a number of the malicious use cases they cite, including to impersonate people for targeted cyberattacks, identity fraud, or to monitor/surveil individuals. As well as the statement being made public, the regulators note that a copy has been sent directly to YouTube’s parent company, Alphabet; TikTok’s parent ByteDance; Meta (owner of Instagram, Facebook and Threads); Microsoft (LinkedIn); Sina Corp (Weibo); and X (aka, the platform previously known as Twitter) — so mainstream global social media platforms are clearly front-and-center as the international watchdogs consider the privacy risks posed by data scraping. Some platforms have of course already had major data scandals linked to data scraping — such as the 2018 Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal which hit Facebook after a developer on its platform was able to extract data on millions of users without their knowledge or consent as a result of lax permissions the company applied; or the $275 million General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) penalty Facebook was handed last year in relation to a data scraping incident that affected 530 million users as a result of insecure product design. (The latter incident is also subject to a lawsuit by an Irish digital rights group that’s challenging the DPA’s enforcement finding that there was no security breach.) While the regulators’ joint statement contains a clear shot across the bows of mainstream social media site on the need to be proactive about protecting users’ information from scraping, there is no commensurately clear warning accompanying the message that failure to act and protect people’s data will result in enforcement action — which does risk diluting the statement’s impact somewhat. Instead, the watchdogs urge platforms to “carefully consider the legality of different types of data scraping in the jurisdictions applicable to them and implement measures to protect against unlawful data scraping”. “Techniques for scraping and extracting value from publicly accessible data are constantly emerging and evolving. Data security is a dynamic responsibility and vigilance is paramount,” they also write. “As no one safeguard will adequately protect against all potential privacy harms associated with data scraping, SMCs and other websites should implement multi-layered technical and procedural controls to mitigate the risks.” Recommended measures to limit the risks of user data being scraped that are mentioned in the letter include having designated in-house team/roles focused on data scraping risks; ‘rate limiting’ the number of visits per hour or day by one account to other account profiles and limiting access if unusual activity is detected; and monitoring how quickly and aggressively a new account starts looking for other users and taking steps to respond to abnormal activity. They also suggest platforms take steps to detect scrapers by identifying patterns in bot activity — such as having systems to spot suspicious IP address activity. Taking steps to detect bots such as deploying CAPTCHAs and blocking IP address where data scraping activity is identified is another recommendation (albeit bots can solve CAPTCHAs so that piece of advice is already looking outdated). Other recommended measures is for platforms to take appropriate legal action against scrapers, such as sending of ‘cease and desist’ letters; requiring the deletion of scraped information; obtaining confirmation of the deletion; and taking other legal action to enforce terms and conditions prohibiting data scraping. Platforms may also have a requirement to notify affected individuals and privacy regulators under existing data breach laws, the watchdogs warn. The social media giants who were sent a copy of the letter are being encouraged to respond with feedback within a month demonstrating how they will meet regulators’ expectations. The letter does also include some advice for individuals to take steps to help protect themselves against the risks of scraping — including suggesting web users pay attention to platforms’ privacy policies; think carefully about what they choose to share online; and make use of any settings that allow them to control the visibility of their posts. “Ultimately, we encourage individuals to think long term,” they add. “How would a person feel years later, about the information that they share today? While SMCs and other websites may offer tools to delete or hide information, that same information can live forever on the web if it has been indexed or scraped, and onward shared.” The letter also urges individuals who are concerned their data may have been scraped “unlawfully, or improperly” to contact the platform or website in question and if they do not get a satisfactory response it suggests they file a complaint with their relevant data protection authority. So the regulators are encouraging users to be more vigilant about scraping which could, ultimately, lead to an uptick in investigations and enforcements in this area. The dozen international regulators signing the joint statement all hail from non-European Union markets. But, as noted above, EU data protection regulators are already active on data scraping risks through enforcements taken under the bloc’s GDPR. They are also closely watching developments in generative AI services — so concerns raised in the letter look broadly aligned with issues already on the radar of the bloc’s data protection authorities. Notably, Italy’s privacy watchdog slapped ChatGPT with a local stop-processing order earlier this year — which led to a brief break in service while OpenAI rushed out with disclosures and controls. Google’s Bard AI chatbot took longer to launch in the EU than in some other regions after its lead EU privacy regulator in Ireland raised similar concerns. But EU DPAs are simultaneously coordinating on how best to apply the local data protection rules to these novel AI chatbots, including vis-a-vis the crux issue of the lawfulness of the data processing used to train the models in light of the GDPR’s framework. So decisions on the core legality of tools like ChatGPT remains pending in the EU. Earlier this year, France’s DPA, the CNIL, also warned that protection against data scraping will be a key plank of an AI action plan it announced in May."
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/starbucks-is-experimenting-with-scanless-checkout-for-drive-through-users/,TechCrunch,Starbucks is experimenting with ‘scanless checkout’ for drive-through users,"Starbucks is testing a new way for customers to pay for their favorite beverages — without even having to pull out their phone. The company confirmed an internal test of “scanless pay,” a new contactless checkout method that would leverage a Starbucks app’s user’s current geolocation to identify them in the drive-through lane so they wouldn’t have to pull out their phone to pay. The experience is currently only being tested as a proof-of-concept with Starbucks employees, the company told TechCrunch. It doesn’t have a set date as to when such a feature would launch to consumers, or even if it will. If it did, however, such an innovation would likely speed up drive-through times, as customers wouldn’t have to launch the Starbucks app, display their barcode, then wait for the employee to scan their screen — something that can often be tricky in bright sunlight or when the customer isn’t well-positioned at the drive-through window. Instead, a scanless checkout system would allow the employee to simply hand over the customer’s order and have them then be on their way. This could also potentially impact the company’s bottom line as the drive-through could serve more customers in a shorter amount of time. The new technology was discovered by developer and researcher Steve Moser, who found references to scanless pay in the current version of the Starbucks mobile app. Additional text in the app explained “Scanless pay in the drive-through helps you get your order fast. We use your device’s location services to identify you when you arrive so you don’t have to pull out your wallet or device when paying at the drive-through.” The app indicated the feature was available in select locations, but the company told us it’s not open to consumers at this time. Currently, the system works by asking the user to opt into the feature. Once enabled, customers would check in on the mobile app when they arrive at a participating drive-through store, then tell the barista their name and that they’ve checked in, after placing their order. While this system doesn’t mean you can leave your phone at home, customers likely have enough time to fiddle with this extra step while waiting in the drive-through line. Then, when they approach the window, there isn’t anything else to do but accept your order and move on. The development is interesting to note because of Starbucks’ leadership in novel payment solutions. Well before Apple Pay became as ubiquitous as it is today, Starbucks was pioneering the concept of the digital wallet at checkout. Today, its Mobile Order & Pay system for ordering ahead plays a significant role in generating company revenue. In Q2 2023, for example, the company noted that combined with drive-through and delivery, Mobile Order & Pay accounted for 74% of U.S. company-owned revenue, in fact. “As we continue to innovate and invest in the Starbucks Experience for our partners (employees) and customers, we are always testing and exploring new features to ensure an effortless, delightful, and personalized experience for our customers and partners,” a Starbucks spokesperson said, confirming the test to TechCrunch. Starbucks isn’t the only retailer to test out scanless payment tech, of course. Amazon has been developing its own Just Walk Out technology that uses camera systems, an app and machine learning tech to determine what a customer bought at a store so they could just leave when shopping is complete. The retailer has also been developing a palm-scanning system, Amazon One, used by various venues and retailers, including Panera Bread. The downside of Amazon’s systems is that customers aren’t comfortable with the biometrics involved — having their palm scanned to track them, that is. Starbucks’ scanless system, on the other hand, wouldn’t be much different from grocery pickup apps like Instacart or even Starbucks mobile ordering, where you temporarily provide location access so the store knows you’re on your way."
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/amazon-prime-video-ai-features-thursday-night-football/,TechCrunch,Amazon brings new AI-driven features to Thursday Night Football,"As Amazon’s Prime Video gears up for its second year as the exclusive rights holder to NFL’s Thursday Night Football (TNF), the streaming service hopes to give fans a more enhanced viewing experience with a slew of new AI-driven features. During a demo with Prime Video executives, TechCrunch learned about the AI elements coming to TNF this season, as well as the first Black Friday NFL game and when viewers can expect HDR video quality. If we asked someone about sports broadcasting a few years ago, we would have bet artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) would be the last thing on their mind. However, the use of AI and ML models in sports has drastically altered how hardcore fans watch games, allowing them to dive deeper into the analytics. “We don’t want to just put math on the screen,” Betsy Riley, senior coordinating producer at Prime Video, told us. “It’s about using data to tell a deeper story and to bring our fans insights so that they understand the game better. We think doing that lets people understand the chess match that’s unfolding on the field. For us as a tech company, it’s been really fun to dig into the numbers and to think about ways we can innovate and use tech to tell the story of the game in deeper and more meaningful ways.” Amazon introduced AI to TNF last year, including X-Ray, which gives fans real-time access to live statistics and data; Rapid Recap, which generates up to 13 two-minute-long highlights for viewers to catch up on plays during a game and more. And after winning its first Sports Emmy award in May, it’s safe to say the tech behemoth isn’t easing up on the gas. All the new AI features will live within Prime Vision with Next Gen Stats — TNF’s weekly alternate stream that features various graphic overlays on the screen during plays so fans can see stats and analysis in real time. Note that Amazon will internally test the features during tonight’s preseason game at 8 p.m. ET. However, fans won’t be able to experience them just yet. The features roll out on September 14, when the 2023 season begins. (Fans can find the complete TNF schedule on Amazon’s website). Image Credits: Amazon What if we said that AI can predict blitzes? Defensive Alerts is Amazon’s in-house ML neural network that recognizes when defensive players are about to rush the opposing quarterback. A red orb will appear around the players of interest so fans know exactly who to focus on. “It’s able to look at all players’ XY coordinate data, their relationship to each other, as well as their acceleration; where are they moving and how fast are they moving directionally to predict who’s going to blitz,” explained Sam Schwartzstein, TNF Analytics Expert at Prime Video. The ML model was trained on 35,000 plays and will continue to get smarter, Schwartzstein told TechCrunch, adding that it’s identifying blitzes and situations better than offensive linemen. He also said the team has a panel of NFL experts who are former quarterbacks, coaches and offensive linemen that help annotate the plays. “Having this as an in-house neural network can only expand the kind of features that we can do in the future,” he said. Prime Targets (featured in the first image at the very top of the page) works similarly in that a green orb will light up a player that is open for a pass. The feature automatically tracks when a quarterback drops back to get ready to throw a pass, and the receiver (lit up by the green orb) runs out and creates separation from himself and the defenders. This feature was previously called Open Receiver, which tracked which players would most likely convert the first down. Amazon tested it during last season’s games. “This is the first statistic that is measuring the process of the play,” Schwartzstein noted. “Everything that we do on Prime Vision is predictive… This is all in real-time.” Amazon is also launching a feature that may help fans understand how fourth-down decisions are made while potentially helping teams prepare for fourth downs. The fourth down territory is an area on the field that offensive players use in an attempt to tie or win the game. Historically, coaches usually opt to punt the ball away since it feels less risky. However, as years go by, more and more teams are going for the fourth down conversion. Instead of putting analytics on the screen after the play happened, Fourth Down Territory operates like a real NFL analytics coordinator does; it shows viewers exactly when a team should try a fourth down and what the probability is. NFL fans are accustomed to seeing field goal target lines on broadcasts — the digital line that appears at the end of half or end of the game, where if a team gets to it, they can kick a field goal. Amazon’s Field Goal Target Zones feature will have multiple lines on the screen that tell viewers the likelihood that a kicker will make a field goal at each point. Key Plays gives fans the ability to view in-game highlights and critical moments, whether they’re already watching the game live or streaming on demand afterward. Much like Rapid Recap ensures fans never miss the action, Key Plays leverages AI and machine learning to offer viewers a full rundown of what’s happening on the field. Amazon and the NFL announced last fall that Prime Video would exclusively stream the NFL’s first Black Friday game on November 24, with the Miami Dolphins playing against the New York Jets and an expected kick-off at 3 p.m. ET. Notably, the game will be free to watch for non-subscribers. The e-commerce giant will also use this as an opportunity to promote exclusive shopping deals to viewers. During a press call earlier this week, Prime Video’s global head of sports, Jay Marine, hinted that Amazon has some “interesting things” planned for Black Friday that will be “additive” for fans. While the company declined to share more details, Riley told TechCrunch that we can expect to hear more in the coming weeks. It’s our guess that Amazon will roll out interactive shopping elements in order to take advantage of the busiest shopping day of the year. The company launched last year a dedicated fan store page, TNF Central, offering TNF-related items, NFL-branded merch and Amazon devices. We also spoke with Eric Orme, who serves as director of live events at Prime Video. Orme oversees global product, engineering and operations for live sports events, including Thursday Night Football, the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, MLB, NBA and U.S. Open tennis, among others. Prime Video will likely see a surge in viewership during the Black Friday game since everyone will be home for the holiday weekend. However, Orme is confident it will be a smooth streaming experience for all viewers. “We work really closely with the retail teams and everybody’s leveraging AWS, so we spend a lot of time around traffic projections,” Orme said. “We ran a bunch of scenarios and are really confident where we think that number is going to be.” While the streamer already tested HDR streaming last season, it will officially be available to all TNF viewers this year. Many fans will likely appreciate the visual upgrade because it provides a more compelling experience, with greater contrast and vivid colors. The company said it would be available on any HDR-enabled device, and subscribers don’t need to change anything in settings as the livestream will automatically be upgraded."
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/sony-is-buying-gaming-headphone-maker-audeze/,TechCrunch,"Sony is buying gaming headphone maker, Audeze","Sony Interactive Entertainment (basically the PlayStation wing) today announced plans to acquire Audeze, the company has confirmed with TechCrunch. The Orange Country, California-based firm is best known for its high-end headphones, targeted at gamers and audio producers. The hardware is often priced into four-figures, but the company earns consistently high marks from reviewers and users alike. In a release announcing the news, the companies are quick to note that operating under the Sony banner won’t mean platform exclusivity (at least not at first). Audeze will continue to produce gaming headphones for competitors, including — presumably — the Xbox. PlayStation-branded products, however, are almost certain to follow. “Audeze is a premier brand for headphones, and this acquisition highlights Sony Interactive’s focus on innovation and providing the best audio experience to PlayStation players,” says SIE SVP Hideaki Nishino. “We’re excited to bring Audeze’s expertise into the PlayStation ecosystem, building on the great strides we’ve made with PlayStation 5’s Tempest 3D AudioTech and the Pulse 3D wireless headset.” Audeze, meanwhile, says the deal will offer the company a wider reach. It’s a hard fact to argue, given Sony’s massive footprint. “Sony Interactive provides Audeze with a unique opportunity to scale our business, as we continue with our mission to deliver best-in-class headphones to recording professionals, audiophiles and gamers,” says CEO Sankar Thiagasamudram. “We’re also looking forward to contributing to Sony Interactive’s efforts to take PlayStation audio experiences to the next level.” In addition to its gaming lines, Audeze also produces a speakerphone and reference headphones and in-ear monitors for music production. Sony, meanwhile, is readying the release of Portal, a $200 portable PS5 streaming handheld. Sony has confirmed that the Audeze brand will continue going forward, while the company maintains offices in the OC. Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed “due to contractual commitments.”"
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/x-twitter-blocked-links-to-a-democratic-political-tool-for-a-week/,TechCrunch,X (Twitter) blocked links to a Democratic political tool for a week,"Formerly known as Twitter, the social platform X temporarily blocked links to EveryAction’s NGP VAN, possibly the most popular political organizing software for Democratic and progressive campaigns. For a week, links to volunteer event signups, donation portals and other resources for left-leaning political causes were unable to be shared on the platform, limiting their reach. When trying to post a link, users would be met with an error message, stating that the link “has been identified by Twitter or our partners as being potentially harmful.” “On Wednesday, August 16, we became aware of an issue preventing links from our secure.ngpvan.com domain from being shared on X (formerly known as Twitter),” a representative for NGP VAN said in a statement to TechCrunch. “In the past, we’ve had direct contacts at Twitter that helped us solve problems quickly, however, those contacts no longer work for the organization.” TechCrunch was unable to reach X for comment. On Wednesday night, NGP VAN turned to its followers for help, asking them to report the error as well, since the company’s own outreach was ineffective. By Thursday morning, the issue was resolved. Under Elon Musk’s ownership, X has had multiple spats with competing social platforms, and X responded by limiting its users’ ability to engage with content from those platforms. When Musk first bought the company in October, the open source, federated platform Mastodon emerged as an early alternative for fleeing users. By December, Musk’s company suspended Mastodon’s account and flagged links to some Mastodon servers as “potentially harmful,” surfacing the same error message that users saw last week when posting NGP VAN links. Then, when Substack launched its Twitter-like Notes feature in April, Musk’s company responded by suppressing Substack links two days later. Users could post Substack links, but others would be unable to like, retweet or reply to those posts. These issues have since been rectified, but the timing struck Mastodon and Substack executives as suspicious — representatives from both companies spoke out against Twitter at the time. “Not a good sign if you need to build a wall to keep people in,” Mastodon wrote on its now unbanned account. It’s not clear why X blocked NGP VAN links, or if the block was an error. But as election season draws near in the U.S., the inability for activists and organizers to link to sites hosted on political organizing software could set a bad precedent. The tech behind U.S. political campaigns tends to be highly partisan, as some major companies only license their software to party-aligned causes. For example, while more liberal causes will use ActBlue to fundraise, conservative groups use a very similar platform called WinRed instead. Especially since the coronavirus pandemic, digital organizing has become campaign workers’ bread and butter. NGP VAN became even more central to this when its parent company EveryAction acquired Mobilize, a popular platform for organizing virtual campaign events. “NGP VAN is a significant resource for organizers to reach and maintain broader networks of potential voters and volunteers,” Shayna O’Reilly, a former campaign worker and current HR lead at a political research firm, told TechCrunch. “Sharing RSVP links to Mobilize events online, for example, presents opportunities for people to engage with campaigns and advocacy organizations in a more comfortable, accessible way.” Though the issue is now resolved, an NGP VAN representative told TechCrunch that X has not explained why the links were blocked in the first place."
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/x-tries-to-lure-back-advertisers-with-new-250-ad-credit/,TechCrunch,X tries to lure back advertisers with new $250 ad credit,"X, the company formerly known as Twitter, has a new initiative aimed at luring smaller businesses to advertise on its platform. The company announced on Wednesday it would offer a one-time ad credit of $250 to select businesses when they spend $1,000 or more on new ad campaigns over the next 30 days. In its post, X touted that more than eight in 10 active X customers were small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) — the segment of the market where X is directing its new promotion. In a related FAQ, X says the ad credits will expire on December 31 of the year they were issued and may be subject to a minimum spend. The announcement follows an interview that X CEO Linda Yaccarino recently did with CNBC where she broadly discussed X’s future plans. She told the outlet that X was integrating AI-powered ad tech that lets brands choose how careful they want to be about the kinds of content their ads are placed alongside. The ad slots that are less conservative would be sold at a discount. Yaccarino also highlighted advertisers that were returning to X, including Coca-Cola and State Farm, after Elon Musk’s chaotic takeover of the company had led many major advertisers to depart or at least re-evaluate their ad spend. Despite Yaccarino’s assurances, the reality of the situation is that Twitter/X advertising revenue has been on the decline. According to a June piece by The New York Times, Twitter/X’s U.S. advertising revenue for the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was $88 million — a drop of 59% year-over-year, the report said, citing internal documents the outlet had obtained. In addition, Twitter/X had fallen short of U.S. weekly sales projections by as much as 30% on a regular basis, it noted. Even X owner Musk has talked about the ad revenue decline, posting just last month that X was still seeing negative cash flow due to a roughly 50% drop in ad revenue and heavy debt. Surprisingly, Yaccarino claimed only a month later that X was “pretty close to breaking even,” crediting X’s API, data licensing and subscription businesses as aiding with that, alongside advertising as helping reach that goal. While ad credits are a common business practice, it’s clear that in X’s case, it’s more in need of a promotion to give brands a little push."
2023-08-24,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/how-google-cloud-learned-to-embrace-its-partner-ecosystem/,TechCrunch,How Google Cloud learned to embrace its partner ecosystem,"Google Cloud’s annual Next event is happening in San Francisco next week (and we’ll be on the ground to cover all of the announcements), but ahead of the event, Google Cloud today put a spotlight on its partner ecosystem. It’s no secret that in its early days, Google’s cloud efforts were somewhat hindered by its inexperience in working with large enterprises and the consultancies, professional service firms and partners they rely on. But when Thomas Kurian took on the CEO role in 2019, he set Google Cloud on a path to build out that expertise and an open partner ecosystem, which is now starting to pay off. In a blog post today, Google puts its focus on its AI and data services partners like Confluent, DataRobot, MongoDB, Redis, DataStax, Elastic and Neo4j. Given the current hype around generative AI, that’s perhaps no surprise, but this is also the story of Google Cloud learning how to sell to enterprises and embracing more traditional ways of selling to them. “We have support from the top all the way to the bottom — top-down from Thomas [Kurian] — on us creating the most open ecosystem we can,” Stephen Orban, the VP for Migrations, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and Marketplace at Google Cloud, told me. “We build our products and services on open standards and embrace that from a product development perspective, but we’re also making sure we have the most open ecosystem […] where we have ISVs and partners who both complement and extend our platform that we lean into quite heavily — and we view it as a strategic lever for our growth.” When the ISVs grow, Google Cloud grows, after all. One muscle Google Cloud had to build over the years is co-selling with its partners. In its early days, Google hoped that its technology would essentially sell itself, but these days, the Google Cloud marketplace is stocked with solutions from hundreds of vendors, many of which have close relationships with Google (and the other hyperclouds) to market and sell their products together. Alan Chhabra, MongoDB’s executive VP for worldwide partners and international sales, noted that he thinks this change is in part due to Kurian’s experience at Oracle. “I was very excited because I knew of Thomas’s history and experience and accomplishments at Oracle. He was an engineering-first CEO but really understood go-to-market. I consider him very similar to MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria. They know how to cross engineering with sales better than most CEOs in the world and I felt like Google needed that at the time — because it is a balance.” He explained that MongoDB quickly established a close business and engineering partnership with Google after Kurian took over. “We had a phone call and in that call, Thomas explained that he wanted to be the cloud that embraced open source,” Chhabra said. It’s worth noting that at the time, many open source businesses, including MongoDB, were wrestling with how to react to the likes of AWS releasing their own services based on existing open source projects. It was at Kurian’s first Cloud Next in 2019 that the company announced that it would deeply integrate products from open source companies like Confluent, DataStax, Elastic, InfluxData, MongoDB, Neo4j and Redis Labs — a list that looks quite similar to the partners the company is highlighting today. While Google didn’t spell it out at the time, that announcement was very much meant to draw a line between how Google Cloud and AWS were going to work with open source companies. That approach is now paying off for Google and its partners. “I remember that moment because they were there for the open source community,” Chhabra said. “They were there for database and data companies like MongoDB and we remember that and loyalty is important to us. Since then, we’ve had phenomenal growth between the two companies, especially in verticals like retail. And we’ve got a commitment with Google and they’ve committed items to us.” Data is obviously the lifeblood of AI and even though Microsoft, thanks in large parts to its OpenAI partnership, is often seen as a leader, many enterprises specifically use Google Cloud because of its AI services like Vertex AI. DataRobot CEO Debanjan Saha, who previously worked at AWS and Google, echoed what I heard from other partners as well: “If you look at Google, for a long time, they were a consumer company. The cloud is probably the first enterprise business for them. And there’s a little bit of learning that Google is going through. I think they made a huge amount of progress in the last three or four years, especially after Thomas Kurian took charge of the cloud business. But still, relatively speaking, Microsoft, for example, has been doing that longer than Google has, but I think Google is learning very fast and the gap is closing.” He noted areas where Google could still improve, including the processes for co-marketing, co-selling and marketplace execution. “I know that they’re working really hard on those,” Saha added. Google’s Orban noted that the company often looks for partners that complement its services. “That’s all about recruiting the ISV, making sure they’re well-architected on Google Cloud with their solution. Most ISVs, I would say, lean towards the SaaS model now. They’re building their SaaS in such a way that it is optimized for going to market with us. It’s about building the joint go-to-market together.” These days, those discussions also often become about generative AI and how Google can help enterprises leverage it. “GenAI has overnight become a CEO- and boardroom-level conversation, where cloud migrations sometimes are traditionally a CIO-level agenda,” Orban said. “So overnight, we’ve seen the demand from customers from very high up in the organization. And we’re in a very fortunate position where a lot of customers have come to trust and recognize Google as a brand for artificial intelligence.” He noted that while Google has its own foundational models, it still partners with the likes of Anthropic and Cohere. “Our strategy is quite explicit: to build the most open and innovative AI ecosystem on Earth,” he said. “If our customers want to work with a particular partner, we want to be there to support them and make sure that they have a great experience on Google Cloud.”"

Image Credits: Vessel Capital While the capital will be invested mainly in startups focusing on application-specific infrastructure, the firm is open to exploring other categories as well, Uddin said. “On a high level, we really wanted to build a new type of venture fund,” Uddin said. “A lot of giant funds are getting raises, but the VCs themselves don’t have a lot of skin in the game when it comes to using their own capital.” Uddin thinks having a background as founders puts his firm at an advantage. “Oftentimes, [VCs] don’t have expertise in the things they’re investing in.” Maybe in a superficial sense an investor understands what DeFi is or how infrastructure works, but unless they’re “really in the trenches going through the process,” it’s hard to comprehend it fully, he said. “The world has enough VCs, but what’s actually missing is actual guidance and advice. Most times you’ll get a nice check, a pretty logo on your website, but other than that VCs don’t help much aside from intros from time to time.” Vessel wants to work with founders and be on the ground with them while they scale their companies, he added. Chen also serves as the CEO of Injective Labs, a blockchain for web3-focused financial apps, and Uddin is the head of business development for that company. Anzalone is one of the co-founders of Burnt, which is building a web3 community platform and blockchain (it previously wanted to create its own NFT marketplace). While in stealth, Vessel invested in “dozens” of companies, including Injective, Burnt and Omni, a layer-1 blockchain, Uddin said. In general, the firm doesn’t have plans to scale “a lot and invest left and right,” but wants to focus on helping founders, Uddin said. “Venture funds get announced all the time, but we really wanted to treat this like we’re launching a new startup.”"
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/amazon-luna-app-launches-on-lg-smart-tvs/,TechCrunch,Amazon Luna app launches on LG smart TVs,"LG is teaming up with Amazon to bring the Amazon Luna cloud-based game streaming service to its smart TVs. Amazon announced on its blog that the Amazon Luna app is now available on LG’s smart TV models launched between 2021 and 2023 and running webOS 6.0 or later. The app is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Germany and the U.K. Amazon Prime members can access a rotating set of titles for free, including “Fortnite,” through the Luna app. But to access the larger catalog — including games like “Sonic Mania Plus,” “Resident Evil 2” and “Lego DC Super Villians” — users must pay $9.99 for a Luna+ subscription. Users also can purchase other bundles like Ubisoft+ for $17.99 a month, which gives them access to titles like different versions of “Assassin’s Creed” and “Farcry,” and Jackbox games for $4.99 per month that unlocks a set of multiplayer party games. Users can play games through a Luna Controller, the Luna Phone Controller app, or a compatible Bluetooth-based controller. Last August, Amazon Luna — which launched in the U.S. in March 2022 — made its app available on Samsung Smart TVs. The latest partnership with LG will bring the service to more big screens. Earlier this year, Amazon dropped nearly 50 titles from Luna. Currently, the game streaming service offers nearly 177 titles, including games offered on various channels."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/neurowyzr/,TechCrunch,"Backed by Peak XV and Jungle, Neurowyzr puts the focus on brain health","The rate of dementia is expected to double every 20 years, but many tools for early detection, like MRI scans, are difficult for patients to access. Neurowyzr wants to help more people get brain healthcare through tools like its online Digital Brain Function Screen (DBFS). The startup, which has offices in Singapore and India, announced today it has raised $2.1 million in seed funding. The oversubscribed round was led by Jungle Ventures and Peak XV’s (formerly Sequoia India and Southeast Asia) Surge program, with participation from angel investors. Neurowyzr has now raised $3.3 million since it was founded in 2019 by Nav Vij and Pang Sze Yunn. It will participate in 2023 Medtech Innovator Asia Pacific, the world’s largest medtech accelerator program. Vij, Neurowyzr’s chief digital neuroscientist, became interested in early brain decline and related therapies while studying for his neuroscience degree at the University of Melbourne. One of his family members was diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease at a young age, which motivated Vij to remove obstacles to brain healthcare. Pang, who has worked on pioneering health initiatives, including Asia’s first heart failure monitoring project, got interested in brain healthcare because she saw the impact brain conditions can have on family members, especially women caregivers. Pang told TechCrunch that a lot of work in neurology currently focuses on treatment for serious brain conditions. But brain decline can start 20 to 40 years before a condition like dementia, mental illness or stroke emerges. As a result, early detection is crucial. Neurowyzr co-founders Pang Sze Yunn (CEO) and Nav Vij (chief digital neuroscientist). Image Credits: Neurowyzr Traditional brain tests like pen-and-paper tests can be affected by tester bias, while MRI and CT scans are expensive and inaccessible to many patients. Neurowyzr wants to address the gap with its digital neuroscience assessment tool, the Digital Brain Function Screen (DBFS). Meant to be faster and less costly than traditional cognitive testing, DBFS is currently used by healthcare organizations like Parkway Shenton, SATA Commhealth, Farrer Park Hospital, MHC Medical Centre (Amara) and O’Joy in Singapore. It has also completed a pilot with a large private hospital chain in India and is registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Singapore Health Sciences Authority and Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration. Pang said the DBFS can be completed in 15 to 20 minutes. It assesses a patient’s immediate memory, working memory, attention and executive brain function through a series of gamified neuroscience puzzles. For example, one puzzle has dots with a number on each scattered across the screen, and asks the users to connect them in order. Another shows a series of numbers that users need to memorize and then write in order. DBFS is hosted online, so patients can access it through a web browser link at home, though it was designed for primary care settings. Neurowyzr’s new funding will be used on product development and regional expansion in Southeast Asia and India. The startup is currently working with academic organizations like the NTU Lee Kong Chian School Medicine’s Dementia Research Centre to develop more digital brain health solutions, with the goal of decreasing undetected cases of early brain decline. In a statement, Jungle Ventures healthcare partner Seemant Jauhari said, “Projected numbers tell a stark story for Asia: over the next two decades, more than 66 million individuals could face dementia, while mild cognitive impairment could affect over 400 million. Neurowyzr is a direct response to this challenge. By assessing brain and mental health promptly, we’re building a proactive defense against potential epidemic.”"

Dear Sophie, I’m a startup founder in Berlin. I just returned from a visit to Silicon Valley where I met with a new customer. On the trip, I realized I need to be based in the U.S. to grow our base with U.S. customers.  What are the best visa options for me and my family? Will any of them allow my husband to work and continue his career? — Seeking Scale  Hey there, Seeking! Kudos to you on your business successes so far — and for your courage to take the next big leap to relocate to the U.S.! I’m honored that you reached out as you and your family begin your journey. I’ve got you! You may be able to avoid having to go through an in-person consular interview for L-1 or O-1 visas if you apply now because until the end of this year, the Department of State has given consular officers the discretion to waive the visa interview requirement for certain work visas if the beneficiary was previously issued a visa and has never been refused one. Consult an immigration attorney who can guide you to the best immigration options for your and your family based on your circumstances, timing and goals. There are a variety of options that might apply to you, based on various factors such as having a co-founder in a specific role or your citizenship in certain countries, but for now let’s dive into two of the visa options for you and your family so you can compare the general pathways! If you have worked for your startup for at least 12 continuous months in the past three years and can document your employment through payroll slips or tax documents, your startup can file for an L-1A visa for intracompany transferee executives or managers for you to come to set up an office in Silicon Valley. To get an L-1A visa to open a new office in the United States, your company will need to sponsor you for the visa and show that you’ve secured a physical office location. Your company may also submit business plans, growth models, and organization charts. If you’re setting up a new office in the U.S. and are approved for an L-1A, that type of visa will can be initially valid up to one year. To extend the L-1A beyond that, you need to show that your U.S. business met your growth models and that the business is viable. "
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/nvidias-q2-earnings-prove-its-the-big-winner-in-the-generative-ai-boom/,TechCrunch,Nvidia’s Q2 earnings prove it’s the big winner in the generative AI boom,"Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings, which were reported Wednesday after markets closed, prove there is money to be made — and lots of it — selling the picks and shovels of the generative AI boom. “A new computing era has begun. Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. Huang isn’t wrong. Nvidia has become the main supplier of the generative AI industry. The company’s A100 and H100 AI chips are used to build and run AI applications, notably OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Demand for these demanding applications has grown steadily over the last year, and infrastructure is shifting to support them. A number of cloud service providers recently announced plans to adopt Nvidia H100 AI hardware in their data centers, according to Huang, who added that enterprise IT system and software providers also announced partnerships to bring Nvidia AI to every industry. “The race is on to adopt generative AI,” he said. Nvidia reported revenue of $13.51 billion in the second quarter, a figure that crushed Wall Street expectations and was double the $6.7 billion it generated in the same period last year. Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance forecast Q2 revenue of $11.22 billion. Nvidia reported GAAP net income of $6.18 billion compared to $656 million it earned in the same year-ago period — upwards of a ninefold gain. Nvidia’s net income skyrocketed even from the first quarter when it reported earnings of $2.04 billion. Its earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $2.48, up 854% from the same period last year. Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected earnings per diluted share of $2.09. The results show how dramatically its business has changed. The company’s gaming unit was once the main driver of revenue. And while gaming is growing — its Q2 revenue was $2.49 billion, up 22% from last year — it’s now overshadowed by its data center unit. Nvidia’s data center business generated $10.32 billion in revenue, up 141% from the previous quarter and up 171% from a year ago. Huang said earlier this month during a keynote at SIGGRAPH in Los Angeles that the company made an existential business decision in 2018 to embrace AI-powered image image processing in the form of ray tracing and intelligent upscaling: RTX and DLSS. That bet has paid off. And Nvidia has forecast even more growth. The company forecast revenue of $16 billion for the third quarter, plus or minus 2%. “The world has something along the lines of about a trillion dollars’ worth of data centers installed in the cloud,” Huang said during the company’s earnings call Wednesday. “And that trillion dollars of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We’re seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time.” He said accelerated computing is the most cost-effective, most energy effective and the most performant way of doing computing now. Now, computing, enabled by generative AI, has come along. “This incredible application now gives every everyone two reasons to transition to do a platform shift from general purpose computing — the classical way of doing computing — to this new way of doing computing accelerated computing,” he said."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/epics-first-run-offers-100-revenue-share-to-game-devs-in-exchange-for-exclusivity/,TechCrunch,Epic’s First Run offers 100% revenue share to game devs in exchange for exclusivity,"Epic’s ongoing quest to dethrone Steam as the PC gaming storefront of note has taken a new turn with First Run, an option for developers to get 100% of their game’s sales revenue in exchange for being an exclusive on the platform for six months. But is this really a good choice? First Run, which will be available starting in mid-October, is seemingly an attempt to woo developers who are getting tired of paying Steam’s 30% share, an industry standard rate but nevertheless one many feel is excessive. The Epic Games Store already offers a more generous 12% cut, but creators can and do list their game elsewhere at that tier. In addition to getting all the net sales revenue, games in First Run will get “exclusive badging, homepage placements, and dedicated collections. In addition, products will be featured in relevant store campaigns including sales, events, and editorial as applicable.” So they’ll push it harder. Though it sounds nice, the deal may not be a good one for as many as you’d think. Steam, for all its shortcomings and 30% off the top, is the de facto platform for PC gamers, and developers have shared that when their game is available on both Steam and Epic, the latter makes up only a small fraction of sales. True, many developers took exclusivity offers — but those were because Epic paid cash up front depending on what they felt they might earn from that exclusivity. For some independent developers, getting (say) $150,000 guaranteed was far superior than a chance at twice or 10 times that. Small dev teams have bills to pay and the Epic exclusivity buyouts were a good way to hedge bets and keep the lights on — after a while, they’d head to Steam anyway. But the fact remains that Epic is asking them to trade 70% of a big pie for 100% of a smaller pie — perhaps much smaller. Epic is an active platform, but a lack of features makes it hard to recommend as a real alternative to Steam. Years in and there are still no reviews! The Steam reviews economy is so strong it is a self-contained internet subculture. Not to mention the various other nice-to-haves the venerable game store has built up over its many years of operation. It may not be a viable option for small developers — though they will know best whether it might actually be — but larger companies may actually bite. If you’re publishing a fairly big game on PC that you know people will buy, but you don’t have your own store (or your own store sucks), Epic could make for a better sales channel than Steam. We’ll likely see a few companies testing the waters here. Does this new program mean Epic is feeling good, or that it’s hurting for customers? It’s impossible to say, though certainly it has not emerged as a credible challenger to Steam over the last years, despite pumping huge sums of money into giveaways and exclusives. It turns out that while people are happy to cash in a freebie, they also like to have a reason to stay — and that’s what Epic seems to be having trouble delivering."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/omers-ventures-europe-exit/,TechCrunch,OMERS Ventures didn’t exit Europe because of the market — but it had good reason to,"A few weeks ago, Bloomberg reported that OMERS Ventures, the venture capital firm backed by the Ontario Municipal Employees’ Retirement System, was calling it quits in Europe just four years after opening a London office, hiring a team and setting aside $332 million to invest in the region. At the outset, it may seem as if the lackluster state of the European venture market may have motivated the exit, but it appears that wasn’t the case. Instead, OMERS’ exit was rather due to logistics related to being a solo LP operation, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch+. OMERS Ventures did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Even though OMERS didn’t leave because of how things are in Europe right now, it wouldn’t have been that surprising if it did. The startup ecosystem in Europe doesn’t look that great at the moment, with lower deal and exit activity than the U.S., which itself is struggling. Europe had only 1,332 deals in the first half of 2023, marking a decrease of 34.2% from the second half of 2022 and a decline of 60.8% compared to the same period a year earlier, according to PitchBook. The U.S. is the world’s biggest startup market at the moment, but the difference in deal count and activity is stark, even accounting for the general slowdown: The U.S. had 6,514 deals close in the first half of 2023. European startups also seem to be finding it hard to exit, or are at least unable to land deals at valuations they might like. Through the first half of this year, startup exits only generated €3.5 billion ($3.8 billion) in total. If things don’t improve soon, the European market will not be able to surpass, or even match, the exit volume of any year from the last decade. Investors from elsewhere in the world seem less interested, too. U.S. investors participated in 746 deals in Europe in the first half of 2023. compared to 1,704 a year earlier, according to PitchBook data. Given how much U.S. investors have pulled back from the region, OMERS wouldn’t have been out of place had it done so because of market conditions. "
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/,TechCrunch,Apple lends support to California State Right to Repair bill,"In a surprise move, Apple this week penned a letter to California state senator Susan Talamantes Eggman, voicing support for SB 244, a “right to repair” bill currently making its way through Sacramento’s State Capitol building. Apple has, of course, softened its stance on right to repair legislation in recent years, including last year’s addition of a Self Service Repair program. The offering, which was viewed by many as a preemptive measure against looming state and federal legislation, provides users with rental tools to repair iPhones and Macs at home. SB 244 is fairly expansive; it includes consumer electronics (phones, laptops, etc.) and appliances (microwaves, washing machines, etc.), though a few exceptions have been carved out, including game consoles and alarm systems. The rational for those appear to be piracy and security, respectively. It shares a good deal (including the proposed name) with the Right to Repair Act, which went into effect in Minnesota this May. In the letter, Apple expresses its support on the grounds of offering consumers the ability to repair their devices safely, without risking privacy or data issues. “Apple supports California’s Right to Repair Act so all Californians have even greater access to repairs while also protecting their safety, security, and privacy,” the company says in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “We create our products to last and, if they ever need to be repaired, Apple customers have a growing range of safe, high-quality repair options.” This sort of backing from a specific manufacturer is unusual — particularly from Apple. It is thus far the only major manufacturer to express its support for the bill in this manner. These kinds of statements are generally made through industry consortiums, such as TechNet. It will undoubtedly be a big boon for Eggman and co-author Senator Nancy Skinner. Apple is, after all, a nearly $3 trillion company that has called California home since the mid-70s. “Apple’s support for California’s Right to Repair Act demonstrates the power of the movement that has been building for years and the ability for industries to partner with us to make good policy to benefit the people of California,” Sen. Eggman says in the release. I’m grateful for their engagement on this issue and for leading among their peers when it comes to supporting access to repair.” Legislators from at least 14 states have introduced similar bills. At the end of last year, New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed the Digital Fair Repair Act, which “requires original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to make diagnostic and repair information for digital electronic parts and equipment available to independent repair providers and consumers if such parts and repair information are also available to OEM authorized repair providers and servicers.” Though, as we noted at the time, the bill had a good deal of concessions to manufacturers: “The bulk of those exceptions were added at the eleventh hour with the approval of Governor Kathy Hochul who said in a statement that they’re intended to lessen the risk of security issues and physical harm while making repairs.” It seems likely that some level of industry compromise is necessary to get these things across the finish line. California’s Right to Repair Act builds on the existing California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, which was enacted back in 1970. The new legislation would require manufacturers to “make available, on fair and reasonable terms, to product owners, service and repair facilities, and service dealers, the means, as described, to effect the diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of the product, as provided,” regardless of warranty. It would also, “require a service and repair facility or service dealer that is not an authorized repair provider, as defined, of a manufacturer to provide a written notice of that fact to any customer seeking repair of an electronic or appliance product before the repair facility or service dealer repairs the product, and to disclose if it uses replacement parts that are used or from a supplier that is not the manufacturer.” The bill passed a Senate vote 38-0 back in May. It is currently awaiting assembly appropriation suspense file approval before going to a full assembly vote."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/two-founders-behind-russian-crypto-mixer-tornado-cash-charged-by-u-s-federal-courts/,TechCrunch,Two founders behind crypto mixer Tornado Cash charged by US federal courts,"The two founders behind Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixing service, have been charged by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, according to a statement on Wednesday. Roman Storm and Roman Semenov were officially charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, according to a newly unsealed indictment. Storm was arrested in Washington on Wednesday but Semenov still remains at large, the SDNY stated. The third co-founder, Alexey Pertsev, who is not mentioned in the filing, is facing legal repercussions in Amsterdam over his role in Tornado Cash. Mixers allow customers to conceal the origin of their crypto funds when transacting in exchange for a fee. While the blending could be used by good actors (who may just want privacy when moving funds), it also allows for potentially tainted crypto funds to be less identifiable.  Tornado Cash was created in 2019 based on open source research by the team behind Zcash, according to its website. Semenov emphasized the platform’s decentralized nature, saying in a January 2022 interview with CoinDesk that the protocol was specifically created to be “unstoppable” and added, “there is not much we can do in terms of helping investigations because the team doesn’t have much control over the protocol.” “While publicly claiming to offer a technically sophisticated privacy service, Storm and Semenov in fact knew that they were helping hackers and fraudsters conceal the fruits of their crimes,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement Wednesday. The charges derived from Tornado Cash operating a platform that had over $1 billion in alleged money laundering transactions, the SDNY said. That includes over $455 million stolen by the Lazarus Group, a North Korean cybercrime organization, according to a statement last year from the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). In August 2022, OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash for its role in enabling over $7 billion in crypto to be laundered through its platform. From that point forward, U.S. citizens and businesses were prohibited from using its service. Alongside the SDNY, Wednesday’s charges included participation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation unit."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/fallout-tv-series-prime-video-2024/,TechCrunch,Fallout TV series set to premiere on Prime Video in 2024,"Prime Video announced Wednesday that the upcoming adaptation of the popular video game Fallout is set to premiere on the streaming service at some point in 2024. Fallout takes place in a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war. Players begin the first game as vault dwellers. As they emerge from the shelter, players must navigate the world above ground to survive against ghouls/zombies, killer robots, raiders and other dangers. Alongside the release date announcement, Prime Video also hints at the location of the series, which will be set around a new vault: Vault 33. The Fallout TV series was initially announced in 2020. Details on the series are slim; however, we know that the creators of HBO’s “Westworld,” Jonathan Nolan (aka Christopher Nolan’s brother) and Lisa Joy, will serve as showrunners. Bethesda Game Studios, which acquired the rights to the Fallout IP in 2007, will be involved in the development of the show. The main cast has also been previously revealed, according to various reports, including “The Shield” actor Walton Goggins, Ella Purnell (the voice behind Jinx in Netflix’s “Arcane”), Kyle MacLachlan (“Twin Peaks”), Xelia Mendes-Jones and Aaron Moten. While an official trailer for Prime Video’s Fallout TV adaptation has yet to be released, the streamer released a behind-the-scenes clip in October 2022. Also, on Fallout’s 25th birthday, Prime Video posted an image of a vault door and three people wearing the number 33. The video game franchise has a large and dedicated fan base, going back to when the first title launched in 1997. The most recent game, Fallout 76, launched in 2018 and sold 1.4 million copies in the year of its release, per SuperData Arcade. Bethesda director and executive producer Todd Howard confirmed Fallout 5 last year. Assuming that Prime Video’s Fallout TV show is a major hit among fans, the series will join the many successful video game adaptations that have debuted recently, including “The Last of Us,” “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” “The Witcher” and more."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/askas-a5-evtol-aircraft-spread-its-wings-but-didnt-fly-at-pebble-beach/,TechCrunch,ASKA’s A5 eVTOL aircraft spread its wings but didn’t fly at Pebble Beach,"I don’t know what I expected the ASKA A5 to look like in person, but the machine lurking in a parking lot just outside of Monterey Regional Airport wasn’t it. Like a cross between a piece of commercial farm equipment and a contraption from G.I. Joe’s nemesis Cobra, the A5 makes a curious first impression. At a minimum, it’s less flying car and more drivable aircraft, and believe it or not that’s an important distinction. I got taken for a quick spin in the A5 across the taxiway at Monterey Regional Airport ahead of the Pebble Beach Concours. It was one of the airport’s busiest days of the year, with high-flying VIPs touching down every few minutes in a near-endless string of private jets. The road-legal prototype A5 looked admittedly awkward amid the rows of Gulfstreams and Learjets. Legal on the road, and newly legal to take to the skies — in limited fashion, at least. The electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) A5 is ASKA’s first product, which received a Certificate of Authorization and Special Airworthiness Certification from the Federal Aviation Administration in June ahead of making its first pilotless test flights just weeks ago. The craft was piloted under remote control. “We don’t need to risk people for our testing,” CEO Guy Kaplinsky said in a recent interview. “We can run it for hundreds or thousands of hours, find all the issues, fix those and then put a pilot here.” These first, tethered hover flights are just the beginning. A5 will need plenty of testing before it’s allowed to move forward to a full FAA certification allowing for broader flights. Once completed, ASKA will qualify for FAA Type Certification, stating the A5 meets all federal regulations, and then Production Certification, which verifies that ASKA can reliably replicate that certified design. That’s a lot of steps to complete between now and 2026, when ASKA plans to have the A5 in production. Image Credits: Tim Stevens Guy Kaplinsky founded ASKA in Mountain View, California with wife Maki in 2018 after selling his previous startup, IQP Corporation, to GE. For their new project, the goal was to move the needle on personal transportation in a way that didn’t require major infrastructure changes. “I wanted to do something different than just another software company,” he told me as we stood next to the A5 on a windy taxiway outside of the airport. Guy and Maki saw transportation as an area ripe for innovation. “Nothing has been developed in the last 100 years. The cars we have today, going from point A to point B, they take the same time. They’re electric, they’re cleaner, it’s great, but at the end of the day it’s the same time,” he said. “And public transportation is not really being developed, because of the cost of building.” Kaplinsky says that the governments haven’t made any major transportation infrastructure changes since the 1980s. “Whenever the government has to invest in infrastructure you know it’s not going to work, because there’s no money to invest,” he said. If you want to radically improve transportation without building new roads and bridges, that means one of two things: going up or going down. The Boring Company’s inability to solve even Las Vegas traffic seemingly points toward the air as a better solution. And so, like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation, ASKA ( which means “flying bird” in Japanese) is aiming high. In addition to vertical takeoffs, the A5’s reconfigurable wings and motors mean it can also take off or land on a runway like a traditional aircraft, or do a sort of hybrid approach for shortened takeoff, relying on the pair of wheel-mounted electric motors to accelerate it up to speed. The two electric motors that drive the rear wheels, plus six more that spin the wing-mounted propellers, are powered by an onboard battery with a capacity of roughly 100 kWh. The target for maximum flight range is 250 miles, enabled by an onboard, gasoline-powered generator to recharge while in-flight. Though largely electric, the A5 won’t be silent. “It’s going to have much less noise than a helicopter,” Kaplinsky said, “but it will still be noisy.” And that is one of the company’s current challenges. Kaplinsky envisions the A5, and its eventual successors, for short-hop airborne ride-hailing, carrying commuters from suburb to city then back again, zipping high above the traffic much like Uber had pledged to do with its Elevate project before selling that business to Joby Aviation in 2020. Uber is something of a target for Kaplinsky, aiming to ultimately offer airborne rides at prices comparable to Uber Black. But, before ASKA can think about the kind of volume that would facilitate those prices, it needs routes, and that means landing an aircraft like this inside densely packed urban areas. This is where the noise becomes an issue. Kaplinsky is optimistic that regulations can be relaxed to allow that kind of operation, but autonomous piloting will require even broader changes from the FAA. For that reason, the company’s initial craft will indeed be human piloted. And where will they land? Kaplinsky says ASKA plans to buy up gas stations once they start going out of business due to the shift toward electrification. Kaplinsky described the A5 as a last-mile solution, although that term doesn’t quite fit. Where the foldable scooters and mini-motorcycles that crowd the last-mile space are designed to make city travel easy by being a cinch to park or carry, the A5 is described as a last-mile vehicle because it isn’t meant to go far or fast on the ground. The company says that once the A5 is in the air it can travel 250 miles on a charge. For my test, though, the A5 would stay purely on the tarmac. Image Credits: Tim Stevens Climbing up in the flying car is a bit awkward, with the cockpit accessed through a thin and remarkably flimsy door that does little to filter out the constant, earsplitting racket of an active taxiway. There’s seating for two (the production vehicle will seat four), but not much in the way of headroom or legroom. Or any room, for that matter. Nor were there any nods toward visual panache beyond the blue and orange vinyl slapped on the dashboard. A trio of displays form the bulk of the interface. The portrait touchscreen on the right has buttons to control things like extending and tilting the wings and flaps. In the center, a vertically oriented display shows an artificial horizon plus other metrics about the drive or flight. Over on the left, behind the pilot’s steering wheel, is the third display, which serves feeds from cameras positioned on the A5’s body. Finally, on the far left is an attitude indicator gauge. Physical controls are limited to a steering wheel, an accelerator, a brake pedal and a shifter. There are no flight controls yet, again because all piloting is remote for now. The A5 prototype’s construction is crude, but the ride was pleasant enough. The chassis groaned and the folded wings above creaked over every asphalt imperfection, but no more so than any other hand-built prototype car I’ve been in. The process of folding out the wings took about two minutes; rear wings lifting and swiveling backward before the shorter front wings folded forward. The six integrated motors can pivot vertically for takeoff and landing then angle forward for flight. With everything deployed, propellers spinning only in the breeze for now, the transformed A5 was a real head-turner. That formerly awkward contraption looked suddenly ready for business. The question, though, is whether ASKA itself is. Kaplinsky declined to comment on how much the company has raised, saying only that they’re not following formal funding rounds. “As a startup, we’re always doing raising, always looking for partners who can understand the potential of the defense business,” he said, “for the civil market, for the commercial market.” ASKA has already performed demonstrations for the U.S. Army, Air Force and Navy at Camp Roberts in Monterey. The hovering tests, meanwhile, are performed at a private airport. In addition to investors, ASKA is looking for customers. While an Uber-like service is the ultimate goal, well-heeled lovers of curious modes of transportation can get on the list for a personal A5 for $789,000. The company has received 100 preorders, each with $5,000 deposits attached."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/meta-and-moderators-agree-to-mediation/,TechCrunch,Meta and moderators agree to mediation on labor dispute,"Content moderators suing Meta and its former content review partner in Africa, Sama, for alleged unlawful dismissal, have agreed to settle the case out of court. The 184 moderators have agreed to mediation five months after they filed the suit, a turn of events that is likely to end one of the most prolific cases that Meta has faced on the continent. This comes after Kenya’s employment and labor relations court asked the parties, during the last directions hearing, to consider settling the matter out of court. “The parties shall pursue an out of court settlement of this petition through mediation. The proceedings of the mediation shall be confidential except the final agreement reached which shall be filed in court and adopted as an order of the court,” said a consent order signed by the moderators, Meta and Sama, and approved by the employment and labor relations court. The parties have picked Kenya’s former chief justice Dr. Willy Mutunga and deputy labor commissioner at the Ministry of Labor and Social Development Hellen Apiyo as co-mediators. The negotiations will take place within 21 days. “Should the parties fail to reach an amicable agreement within the stated time frame, the matter shall proceed before the Employment and Labour relations court,” said the consent order. The moderators sued Meta and Sama for allegedly dismissing them in an unlawful fashion, claiming that no redundancy notices were issued. They added that, among other issues, they were not issued with a 30-day termination notice as is required by Kenyan law, and that their terminal dues were hinged on signing non-disclosure agreements. They also alleged discrimination by Meta’s new content moderation partner, Majorel, who they claim blacklisted all of Sama’s previous employees. The moderators sought compensation for “distress caused,” and for Sama to reverse the redundancy notice. They also wanted Meta, Sama and Majorel to acknowledge their right to unionize. Sama has maintained it adhered to Kenya’s labor laws. Sama hired the moderators from across the continent, including from Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia and South Africa, to filter social media posts on Meta’s platforms. The moderators remove content that perpetrates and perpetuates hate, misinformation and violence, work they claim in the case has affected “their mental health and general well-being.” Sama dropped Meta’s contract and content review services to concentrate on labeling work (computer vision data annotation). Alongside Meta, the company has also been sued by former content moderator Daniel Motaung for forced labor and human trafficking, unfair labor relations, failing to provide adequate mental health support and union busting. Motuang was allegedly laid off organizing a strike in 2019, and trying to unionize Sama’s employees. Meta has also been sued by Ethiopians in Kenya for allegedly fueling the conflicts that led to the deaths of 500,000 Ethiopians during the Tigray War that ended late last year."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/spacex-alums-electric-era-raise-millions-for-reliable-ev-charging/,TechCrunch,SpaceX alums say they’ll bring rocket reliability to EV charging,"Electric Era says it cracked the code for fast and reliable electric-vehicle charging stations that can go wherever they’re needed. Founded by former SpaceX engineers, the startup just announced an $11.5 million Series A round led by HSBC’s asset management arm. Climate-tech fund Blackhorn, lithium-mining giant SQM and mobility-focused investor Proeza also chipped in. Electric Era intends to use that cash to prove that its soon-to-launch PowerNode stations can help turn around public chargers’ wack reputation in the U.S. It’s a worthwhile goal, since subpar and scarce public chargers, as well as grid infrastructure challenges, are altogether slowing down EV adoption in the U.S. — hampering the nation’s decarbonization plans. But is four-year-old Electric Era up for the challenge? Founder and CEO Quincy Lee tells TechCrunch that the team’s experience developing Starlink satellites in particular will help make it happen. Lee worked at SpaceX for seven years, while CTO Sam Reineman spent nine years and software VP Sith Dharmasiri spent seven at the Elon Musk-co-founded private space company. Lee argues that their experience there grants Electric Era both an outsider’s perspective and deep technical engineering competencies. “We’ve really gone from space down to earth and are working on building the infrastructural backbone that EV drivers need,” added Lee. Electric Era is developing its own software — PowerNode OS — and some hardware, while outsourcing other key components. “We don’t build the chargers or the batteries,” said Lee. “We focus instead on the entire EV fast charging station.” The CEO says the startup’s “battery-backed and software optimized” PowerNode stations bring a “rocketry level of reliability” to public EV charging, without requiring serious grid upgrades. These stations can apparently scale up gradually, wherever they’re needed, such as gas stations, convenience stores, grocers and restaurants. “We can, as part of our software stack, incorporate real-time management of battery systems and solar systems to bring energy and generation to the sites, so that we can add more capacity to the grid locally, as opposed to kind of redoing all the wires,” said Lee. As for where you can find a PowerNode station, the company plans to launch in nine states before the end of the year. That’ll be about 27 chargers in total, or about three per station, Lee tells TechCrunch. Lee says the startup’s thesis is that “legacy car refill is dying. They’re facing extinction from this shift to electric forms of transportation, and we are keeping them in business.” Electric Era handles everything from real-time monitoring to on-site energy management. That’s one factor in the company’s plan to keep reliability high. Another is extensive testing, which includes running these power-management systems through “a ton of different crazy edge cases” and charging 20-30 different types of vehicles — Teslas, Rivians, Bolts, Leafs and so on. The company is on a “warpath to have about three gigawatt hours of installed battery capacity and utilities all across the country by 2030,” according to Lee. That’d equate to operating about 10,000 stations across the U.S. — a serious undertaking, but not all that huge a figure if you consider that S&P analysts expect to see 28 million EVs on U.S. roads by the end of the decade. Electric Era has raised $19 million to date, and its Series A values the firm at $48 million (post money)."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/tiktok-plans-ban-links-outside-e-commerce-sites-like-amazon-new-report-claims/,TechCrunch,"TikTok plans to ban links to outside e-commerce sites like Amazon, new report claims","TikTok is planning to ban links to outside e-commerce links, according to a report from The Information, but TikTok denies the claim. The report says the move would be a way for the company to force people to use TikTok Shop if they want to purchase an item that they see on the app. The report also says TikTok Shop is on track to lose more than $500 million in the U.S. this year. The $500 million loss reflects the company’s deep investment in hiring, creating a delivery network and subsidizing merchants that offer discounts and free shipping. If TikTok were to implement a ban on outside e-commerce links, it would be taking a page out of its Chinese sibling app Douyin’s playbook, as the app banned links to other e-commerce sites such as Alibaba’s Taobao in 2020. The reported move is seen as a way for TikTok to boost sales on TikTok Shop, which currently isn’t seeing much traction. Consumers in the U.S. are currently spending around $3 million to $4 million a day on TikTok Shop, up from around half a million to $1 million a day in June, the report says. TikTok staffers expect this number to exceed $10 million by the end of the year. TikTok Shop is a lot more successful in Southeast Asia, where it has been available since 2021. In Southeast Asia, TikTok Shop’s daily gross merchandise volume is around $50 million to $60 million. TikTok hopes to increase this number to around $90 million by the end of the year. ByteDance wants TikTok to create an international online shopping business similar to Douyin, which had a merchandise volume of more than $200 billion last year. The Information reports that the company hopes TikTok can reach similar levels by 2028. Of the $200 billion, ByteDance hopes to generate around $40 billion to $60 billion in revenue from the U.S. The report says TikTok has been working to attract merchants to its platform. For instance, the company’s employees look at bestselling items on Amazon, then reach out to the merchants to convince them to join TikTok Shop, while offering them zero commissions for the first three months. TikTok Shop isn’t the only way that the company plans to expand into e-commerce, as TikTok recently confirmed that it’s testing a new in-app “Trendy Beat” shopping section where it is offering products for sale that are shipped and sold by a subsidiary of ByteDance. The feature is currently being tested in the U.K., but will likely be introduced in the U.S. as well, given that TikTok filed a trademark application in the U.S. for Trendy Beat in May. ByteDance’s plan to start selling its own products in the video app is internally referred to as “Project S,” which leverages TikTok’s knowledge of products that are gaining popularity on the app, allowing ByteDance to either acquire or manufacture those products. ByteDance reportedly uses a network of suppliers to produce these items. Although TikTok’s e-commerce efforts are still somewhat new in the U.S., the app already has a notable influence over users’ shopping habits, as the phrase “TikTok made me buy it” has become popular for the video app’s ability to drive impulse sales. The term currently has 7.4 billion views on TikTok and the hashtag has 67 billion. As TikTok boosts TikTok Shop, the company revealed that it’s sunsetting its storefronts product on September 12. TikTok launched the storefronts back in 2021, when TikTok’s e-commerce offering in the U.S. were very limited. Now that TikTok Shop is available, TikTok no longer sees the need for the storefronts. Update 08/24/2023 11:10 AM ET: The article was updated to reflect that TikTok denied the report’s claim about outside e-commerce links."

In April, the company announced the Google TV service was growing to include over 800 live TV channels, including those from Tubi, Plex, Haystack and others. Today, the company says it’s adding 25 more free channels to the lineup, which can be watched without having to install any additional apps or needing to sign in. With the additions, there are now more than 100 free built-in channels out of the total 800 free channels, Google says. Among the new arrivals are those that include TV shows like “Top Gear” and “Baywatch,” plus game shows, music channels, multicultural entertainment and more. These complement the existing free channels Google added earlier this year, like news channels from NBC, ABC, CBS and FOX, and others featuring shows like “Westworld,” “Law & Order: SVU” and “The Walking Dead.” Image Credits: Google   FAST channels, or free ad-supported television, have seen increased consumer adoption in recent months as consumers tightened up their discretionary spending on subscription streaming services and other expenses that aren’t needed. Combined with rising subscription prices across streamers, including YouTube TV, and password crackdowns at Netflix, free streaming is becoming a popular alternative. According to a recent study by Samba TV, 1 in 3 U.S. users now tune into free ad-supported streaming services, with Amazon’s Freevee seeing the largest growth. Pluto TV, Tubi, The Roku Channel and Crackle were also popular. Image Credits: Google In addition to the free streaming expansion, Google also announced today that it’s integrating YouTube’s NFL Sunday Ticket deal into the Google TV service. Starting this season, the NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube and YouTube TV will be fully integrated into Google TV in the U.S. That means users will be able to “watch live out-of-market Sunday afternoon games, see top highlights and get recommendations for top games of the week,” directly from the Google TV home screen, the company explained. Plus, YouTube TV subscribers who have added Sunday Ticket will also see the content in their channel guide on the Live tab to make it easier to find what they’re looking for."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/cloudnordic-azero-cloud-host-ransomware/,TechCrunch,Danish cloud host says customers ‘lost all data’ after ransomware attack,"Cloud host CloudNordic says most of its customers have “lost all data with us” following a ransomware attack on its data center systems, including its backups. The Denmark-based cloud company said the ransomware attack began Friday, during which cybercriminals “shut down all systems,” including its website and email, and encrypted customer systems and websites. In a notice on its website translated from Danish, CloudNordic said: “The attackers succeeded in encrypting all servers’ disks, as well as on the primary and secondary backup system, whereby all machines crashed and we lost access to all data.” CloudNordic said that while customer data was scrambled in the attack, there was no evidence that customer data was copied out or exfiltrated from its systems, as is a common tactic for ransomware and extortion groups. The company said that in any case it did not have money to pay the hackers’ unspecified ransom demand, nor would it pay. The cloud host said that it believes the hackers had access to the company’s administrative systems “from which they could encrypt entire disks.” “Unfortunately, it has proved impossible to restore more data, and the majority of our customers have thus lost all data with us,” the translated statement on its website reads. It’s not clear how the ransomware attack began, but the company said that the attack happened — or was at least exacerbated — by moving infected systems from one data center to another data center that was “unfortunately wired to access our internal network that is used to manage all of our servers.” CloudNordic said that it “had no knowledge that there was an infection.” “Via the internal network, the attackers gained access to central administration systems and the backup systems.” At the time of writing, no ransomware group has appeared to publicly acknowledge or take credit for the cyberattack. Customers with Azero are also affected, according to an identical notice on its website. CloudNordic and Azero are owned by Denmark-registered Certiqa Holding, which also owns Netquest, a provider of threat intelligence for telcos and governments. Both CloudNordic and Azero said they were working to rebuild customers’ web and email systems from scratch, albeit without their data. CloudNordic could not be reached for comment. Its website notice said that the company had difficulty in communicating. An email with questions about the incident bounced back with an error message saying the message could not be delivered.

2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/late-stage-evaporating/,TechCrunch,The late-stage venture market is crumbling,"If you are a startup founder raising a venture round this year, you’ll get a lower valuation than you might have in 2021 or 2022. New data from CB Insights details that there have been sharp valuation declines across nearly every startup stage around the world. But you probably know that already. A more interesting question to ask, then, is whether deal volume is going to shrivel across stages, too. Sure, it’s useful to know what the new norm is for, say, seed-stage or Series B deals, but it’s far more important to understand how quickly the later stages of the venture market are contracting. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. A sharper decline in late-stage dealmaking may be a bad thing or not, depending on how large you think the startup market could grow before there are too many companies trying to scale at the same time. On one hand, a more extreme decline in late-stage dealmaking would mean that startups past their youth — your Series B and C companies — will find it harder to raise pre-IPO capital from venture investors. On the other, startup stages are not only a way to segment the venture market into simple buckets, but they also serve as a sort of filter to weed out companies that do not meet expectations for growth and scale. From that perspective, a smaller late-stage market would imply that weaker startups would not be able to access capital that they couldn’t use efficiently. That’s brutal for startups stuck between rounds and stages, but it could be a good thing for the wider tech market — quick failures recycle human capital faster than overfunded startups that end up as expensive zombies. This morning, let’s talk about new valuation norms and explore just how sharply the late-stage market is on pace to contract this year. Let’s get the obvious stuff out of the way: No matter which stage we are looking at, median valuations declined in the second quarter of 2023 compared to a year earlier, according to CB Insights. And it appears the later the stage, the sharper the decline: Seed/angel deal valuations fell about 15%, while valuations for Series D rounds and later tanked by a whopping 60%. But things aren’t as straightforward as they might seem: A closer look at more recent periods yields a slightly better picture. Median valuations improved slightly for seed/angel and Series B deals in Q2 2023 compared to Q1 2023. Startups that raised Series D rounds or later, however, still don’t seem to be doing well: Their median valuation declined by 33% quarter-on-quarter. "
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/third-times-the-charm-sony-makes-200-playstation-portal-in-home-handheld-official/,TechCrunch,Third time’s the charm? Sony makes $200 PlayStation Portal in-home handheld official,"Sony has twice tested the waters in portable gaming, with the unsuccessful but fondly remembered PSP and Vita. Third-time lucky is the hope with PlayStation Portal, a handheld gaming device that — there’s no getting around it — is more or less a supercharged version of Nintendo’s endearingly confusing Wii U. Teased in May, the Portal is essentially a PS5 controller (touchpad, haptics and all) split down the middle with an 8-inch, 1080p LCD. It plays any game your PS5 has at 60 FPS by streaming the image over Wi-Fi, though already-streaming games via PS Now and VR ones are not supported. And of course you can’t play on the train or a long flight. As with the Wii U, the idea is that if someone else is using the TV, or if you want to play in the bedroom or kitchen for whatever reason, you can. Though unlike the Wii U, there is no suggestion of asymmetric multiplayer or using the Portal as a special controller in gameplay. Nintendo fumbled the Wii U in countless ways, so the concept has an air of pointlessness about it. And while for some this use case may not hit, don’t underestimate the number of households where kids or parents dominate the TV at prime gaming time. Your friends want to raid but mom is watching the game, or the kids are watching “Frozen 2” for the ninth time today and dad needs to do some inventory management in Horizon: Zero Dawn. Of course there are numerous ways to do this already via existing apps and hardware, but the hope is that the draw of a first-party device will draw people in who want the minimum of fuss on this platform specifically. It didn’t quite work with the Vita, but that was a different time. And although the Switch and Steam deck are visually similar, those are capable of offline use (and the prices reflect this independence). At $200, it’s a bit expensive for an accessory, but if it performs as they describe it in their own (doubtless totally objective) hands-on report, it might be a great option for a fair amount of people to have available. We’ll have to try it in person to see if the image quality and latency are as good as they claim. Image Credits: Sony Obviously itching to show off some new wireless tech they developed, Sony also announced two new pairs of headphones: one over-ear pair (Pulse Elite, $150) that looks like a direct upgrade to the Pulse 3D headset, and some in-ear buds called Pulse Explore ($200). Both feature “custom-designed planar magnetic drivers for an audiophile-level listening experience normally found in premium headphones for professional sound engineers.” Sony makes a lot of cans, so they know of what they speak. I was disappointed with the Pulse 3D headset that came with the PS5, though, so hopefully these are an upgrade. Each comes with a new “PlayStation Link” USB dongle that can quickly switch between associated devices: currently these two pairs plus the Portal use this connection method."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/google-plans-to-bring-ai-fueled-security-enhancements-to-google-workspace/,TechCrunch,Google plans to bring AI-fueled security enhancements to Google Workspace,"As companies move to the cloud, keeping data secure is always front of mind. While Google is quick to point out that it has never had an exploit in Google Workspace, it doesn’t mean it isn’t working to continually stay ahead of security issues. Today, the company announced a number of security-related enhancements to Google Workspace products, including GMail and Drive, some of which will take advantage of AI to automate certain tasks. It’s important to understand that these tools are still in development or various stages of testing, but Google plans to add these updates later this year and in early 2024. For starters, Google wants to enhance its zero trust model, a concept the company helped develop. Google defines zero trust as, “a cloud security model designed to secure modern organizations by removing implicit trust and enforcing strict identity authentication and authorization. Under zero trust, every user, device, and component is considered untrusted at all times, regardless of whether they are inside or outside of an organization’s network.” As part of that approach, Jeanette Manfra, senior director of global risk and compliance at Google, says the company is announcing a couple of new capabilities that combine the idea of zero trust with the notion of data loss prevention (DLP). “We’re bringing the two together, and adding an ability to improve how you classify using AI capabilities within Drive. And so what this does is it automatically and continuously classifies and labels sensitive data, and then applies appropriate risk-based controls,” Manfra said at a press event this week. In addition she said that they are adding enhanced DLP controls to Gmail to enable administrators to prevent users from inadvertently attaching sensitive data, especially when it shows up especially in unexpected places. “So say a customer inadvertently sends sensitive data in a customer support email. This allows a Gmail customer to take the controls and sort of raise the bar on their security policies,” she said. For instance, admins could disable download or prevent copy and paste on those documents. Another big area of focus with these new tools is being sensitive to location and what can be shared, so Google is also adding some context-aware controls in Drive so that admins can set criteria such as a device location that must be met in order for users to share sensitive data. Andy Wen, director of Product Management for Google Workspace, says that the company is also putting AI to work to help admins peruse log data for data breaches and behavioral anomalies, and to look for suspicious actions in Gmail that could indicate a hacker has gained access to the account. Data sovereignty in particular is a big problem for companies, which need to ensure that certain information remains within their control. As part of that, the company currently offers client-side encryption on the desktop, but it plans to add it to mobile versions of Gmail, Calendar and Meet and other Workspace tools. Wen says that central to this is that customers control the encryption keys, meaning that Google can’t see this data, and if law enforcement were to ask, there would be no way for Google to share this information. “Keep in mind that the key benefit of client-side encryption is it protects your data where regionalization can be inadequate,” he said. “We do it by issuing an additional set of encryption keys that only the customer controls. This additional key encrypts the customer data — we call it from browser to browser — so that Google can never actually see the original content,” he said. While the company has let customers choose a data residency location when the data is at rest in the past, it will now add the capability to choose where to process that data. For starters, that will only include the EU or the United States. These and other new features are in development and will be released in the coming months. Google was fuzzy on the pricing details, but it will probably depend on the type of account you have, and the particular feature, whether they are included or you have to pay extra."
2023-08-23,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/youtube-tests-search-feature-users-hum-sing-identify-songs/,TechCrunch,YouTube tests a search feature where users hum to identify songs,"YouTube announced a new experiment on Android devices that determines a song via humming — which seems like a major step up from Apple’s music recognition app Shazam. As noted on YouTube’s support page, the video-sharing platform is testing a search-by-song capability on the Android version of the app that allows users to figure out a song on YouTube by humming, singing or recording a song. Users who have access to the experiment can toggle from YouTube voice search to the new song search feature and hum, sing or record a song for three or more seconds. The platform then identifies the tune and directs the user to relevant YouTube videos featuring the searched song, whether that be the official music video, user-generated content or Shorts. The search-by-song capability is only available to a small portion of Android users. If the feature rolls out more widely, we can see it being helpful for many, as YouTube is a popular destination for looking up songs. YouTube’s latest experiment probably sounds familiar to some users. In 2020, YouTube’s parent company Google first launched the capability on the Google app, Google Search widget and Google Assistant, letting users figure out a song by humming, whistling or singing into the microphone icon. However, the main difference appears to be that Google’s feature requires users to hum for 10-15 seconds in order to identify the song. As Google previously explained, its feature is built on machine learning models that can match a person’s hum to a song’s “fingerprint” or signature melody. The new YouTube test uses the same technology as the Google feature, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Other music recognition apps like SoundHound and MusixMatch can also identify songs by singing or humming the tune, but they aren’t as popular compared to YouTube and Google. (Still, we recommend checking them out as well)."

The tech giant is also expanding its test of end-to-end encryption features to “millions more people’s chats.” The company has been building end-to-end encryption features in Messenger for years now. However, most of them have been optional or experimental. In 2016, Meta started rolling out end-to-end encryption protection through a “secret conversations” mode. In 2021, it introduced such an option for voice and video calls on the app. The company made a similar move to provide an end-to-end encryption option for group chats and calls in January 2022. In August 2022, Meta started testing end-to-end encryption for individual chats. There is increasing pressure on Meta to enable end-to-end encryption so the company or others can’t access users’ chat messages. Protecting individual communications has become more important after a girl and her mother in Nebraska pleaded guilty to abortion charges in July after Meta handed over her DMs to cops. Last year, the police prosecuted the 17-year-old based on data about her direct messages from Messenger provided by Meta soon after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a 1973 judgment to make abortion legal. In a letter to the digital rights advocacy group Fight for the Future (via The Verge) this month, Meta’s deputy privacy officer Rob Sherman said that it will roll out end-to-end encryption to Instagram DMs after the Messenger rollout. He also mentioned that “the testing phase has ended up being longer than we anticipated” because of engineering challenges. In a blog post, the company explained that there were significant challenges in building out encryption features for Messenger. The company had to shed the old server architecture and build a new way for people to manage their chat history through protections like a PIN. Meta added that it had to rebuild over 100 features like showing link previews in conversations to accommodate end-to-end encryption. The company’s popular messaging app WhatsApp has had end-to-end encryption for years, and in recent years it has figured out a way to support multi devices for one account without breaking encryption. Meta said that the Messenger team is learning lessons from WhatsApp to implement end-to-end encryption. After the incident, multiple organizations, including Amnesty International, Access Now, and Fight for the Future wrote a petition to Meta and other platforms to enable end-to-end encryption for private chats. Authorities around the world have been exploring rules that could put encryption in messaging apps at risk. While Meta has pushed back on these proposals through WhatsApp to support end-to-end encryption, it is yet to fully build out these protections for Messenger and Instagram DMs."
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/snap-overhauls-india-organizational-structure-appoints-new-head/,TechCrunch,"Snap overhauls India’s organizational structure, appoints new head","Snap has restructured its reporting system in India and named Pulkit Trivedi as the new country head, underscoring the increasing importance of the South Asian market to the company. Snapchat’s parent company has directed its Indian teams to report directly to Trivedi, thereby granting local leadership greater autonomy in shaping growth, partnerships, and market development, marking a distinctive move. Trivedi will report to Ajit Mohan, the Asia Pacific head of Snap, who joined the company from Meta last year. Trivedi joins Snap from Google, where he served as the director of Google Pay for the India business team. He will take charge of overseeing Snap’s operations in India, encompassing revenue generation, partner support, and fostering the creator community. Previously, Meta employed a similar approach for India, where the local leadership had a broader say, but has changed the structure in recent months in a move that has rattled many senior leaders and teams in the country. “Under a new operational structure, the Growth, Market Development, Partnerships, Content and Creator Ecosystem teams will now report directly to Trivedi,” Snap said in a statement. The move comes as India becomes increasingly important for Snap. A series of changes, including focus on localized features, helped Snapchat make inroads with the wider community in India, including marketers. Snap has witnessed its monthly active user base soar to 200 million in the country, doubling in under two years. It has achieved a 60% reach among the 13–24 age group in India, according to Wells Fargo’s estimates. “I am thrilled to welcome Pulkit to the Snap team at such an exciting time for our organization, both in India as well as more broadly across Asia-Pacific,” said Mohan, who previously led Meta’s India business. “Pulkit’s deep expertise in building and scaling businesses and finding ways to drive outsized growth for partners will enable us to continue delighting our surging community of over 200 Million Snapchatters in India. Unifying our local teams under this new structure will set the right stage for making accelerated investments in India and enable us to further fuel the growth of our community and partners.” India, the world’s most populated country, presents potentially the final significant growth opportunity for American tech behemoths searching for their next wave of several hundred million users. Google and Meta have amassed over half a billion digitally connected Indians monthly. However, in the past few years, particularly for Meta, expansion has decelerated due to challenges in accessing a segment of the population with minimal or no internet and smartphone connectivity."
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/kombai-seed-funding/,TechCrunch,India’s Kombai raises $4.5M to simplify UI coding with AI,"Kombai, a startup that aims to help front-end developers easily convert UI designs to code using AI, has emerged from stealth and announced a $4.5 million in a seed funding round led by Stellaris Venture Partners and Foundation Capital. In response to rapid hardware advancements, software evolution has underscored a pressing need for superior user interfaces. Both emerging startups and leading tech firms are keen to develop distinguishing user interfaces. However, front-end developers often find the swift coding of these unique designs challenging. Kombai’s AI model, aimed at addressing this issue, is scheduled for public research release this Wednesday. The Palo Alto–incorporated startup, which operates from an office in India’s Pune, was founded by former Mindtickle executives Dipanjan Dey (serving as Kombai CEO) and Abhijit Bhole (CTO) in April 2022 — after over 16 months of groundwork. It uses a collection of deep learning and heuristics models, each designed to tackle a specific aspect of interpreting UI designs and generating code from said interpretation. “The model tries to develop an intuitive understanding of the design . . . and then it starts generating the code,” Dey said in an interview. Kombai, named after the Indian dog breed by the dog-loving co-founders, uses a step-by-step approach to creating UI code. In its process, Kombai intelligently clusters logical elements, forming a streamlined div structure while ensuring CSS has minimal hardcoded widths and margins. The generated code is segmented into discernible components, each aptly named to facilitate comprehension and potential reuse. Recognizing patterns, Kombai pinpoints loops and conditions, substituting static text with variables. In its final touch, it leverages publicly available multimodal large language models (LLMs) to refine particular segments of its auto-generated code, culminating in a polished end product. The LLMs account for under 5% of the final output’s character count, while the bulk of it is produced by the AI model directly, Dey said. Even though generating code using AI involves a number of steps in the background, Kombai’s model produces the result in a few seconds to help save plenty of time for front-end developers. The generated code can be downloaded by front-end developers or copied directly into their respective IDEs. Developers can also modify the code depending on their requirements and incorporate it into their codebases. Dey noted that developers typically spend 25% to 75% of their working time writing UI code such as styles in CSS, Document Object Model (DOM) in HTML and framework-specific boilerplate. While the demand and complexity of front-end development have gone up as designing has become crucial for businesses, there is a lack of standardization in front-end technologies, the co-founder told TechCrunch. Before launching its model for public research, Kombai collaborated with more than 500 developers during the last six months as part of its private research preview. The startup looks to emerge as “reverse Dall-E for UI design” and make front-end development fun again for the 5 million front-end and 15 million full-stack developers worldwide, Dey told TechCrunch. Kombai currently requires front-end developers to have a Figma account to sign up or integrate Figma’s API token to fetch designs from the interface design app. However, Dey said the model could potentially be easily integrated with other design tools, including Adobe XD. “The only reason we are not going to XD is primarily because of our bandwidth,” he said. The seed round included participation from 20 angels, including some undisclosed SaaS CEOs and CTOs and a few late-stage investors. “In Kombai’s team, we discovered a rare blend of tech and product expertise needed to solve the problem with a fundamentally new approach. We’re thrilled by the remarkable strides the team has taken in developing the product and the positive developer feedback,” said Alok Goyal, partner at Stellaris Venture Partners, in a prepared statement. Kombai, which currently has a workforce of 13 people comprising senior front-end engineers and deep-learning experts, will expand its team with a few more engineers over the next few months. “Excellent designer tools like Figma and Adobe XD have emerged in the last decade. But they do not generate meaningful code that can be used by developers. On the other hand, LLM-based tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are great for generating code suggestions from textual inputs, but they don’t work for UI development. As a result, developers need to manually translate all parts of a UI design into code, which is frustrating and incredibly time-consuming. We believe this presents a huge opportunity that has practically been begging for a solution. That’s why we’re thrilled to partner with the Kombai team in their mission of enabling the world’s 20 million developers to spend more of their time on hard, interesting problems, not mundane CSS,” said Ashu Garg, partner at Foundation Capital. Kombai plans to utilize some of its funding to start inbound and to continue investing in research and development, improve its base models and build compatibility with a range of libraries and frameworks used by developer teams."
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/solar-ai/,TechCrunch,Solar AI wants to make solar power more accessible in Southeast Asia,"High energy prices are leading to a solar boom across the world, but in Singapore, many home owners are still hesitant to install solar panels because of the high cost, says Bolong Chew, the founder of Solar AI Technologies. The startup wants to make solar energy more accessible in Southeast Asia with a rent-to-own model that helps customers start saving on their energy bills from the start. It recently raised $1.5 million in seed funding, led by Earth Venture Capital with participation from Undivided Ventures, Investible and climate-tech angel investor David Pardo. Solar AI was launched three years ago and incubated through Engie Factory, the venture arm of French utility company Engie Group. Chew, who founded the company along with Gérald Chablowski and Luke Ong, said the team realized that one of the barriers to rooftop solar adoption in Southeast Asia is lack of trust and awareness, since significant upfront costs have led to low adoption. As a result, most people don’t know anyone who has already installed a solar system, despite the rising cost of electricity, and the penetration rate of solar systems is still less than 1%. “The traditional pitch for a rooftop solar system is that you pay $15,000 to $20,000 upfront for it, break even after about seven to eight years and get free electricity for another 20 years,” said Chew. “But when most people don’t know someone who’s already had a solar system for two or three years already, it’s very difficult for customers to take that leap of faith and move ahead. Ultimately, the rental model is a way for us to de-risk solar ownership for these customers.” Solar AI offers three plans, including a five-year plan with 50% down payments, a 10-year plan with zero upfront costs, and a traditional upfront purchase. Monthly fees for the rent-to-own plans are about $200 a month, compared to average electricity bills of $250 a month. Chew says this means customers can start saving $50 a month on their energy costs as soon as they get a solar system installed. Excess solar energy generated is exported to the grid and users get paid for it by the grid operator. In Singapore, that is SP Group, which pays customers directly for excess energy regardless of what electricity retailer they use. Solar AI also covers maintenance and warranty costs during the contract period. Solar AI is currently serving more than 100 customers and says it has surpassed $3 million SGD on signed rooftop solar contracts. The rent-to-own model is already prevalent in the United States and Europe, but Solar AI is the first company to offer it in Singapore. When launching the business model, Chew says the team “asked ourselves, are we really ahead of our time or just stupid?” They spoke with traditional industry players who advised the team against rent-to-own from a unit economics perspective. While large-scale rooftop systems are funded through property agreements, unit costs are much higher for smaller scale projects because of the expense of customer acquisition. Chew said one of the advantage that Solar AI has is that a lot of their sales are done through digital channels, which helps drive unit costs down. Before launching its rent-to-own business, Solar AI had already begun building an audience through educational content on its website. Chew said it is now top ranked in terms of most solar search keywords in Southeast Asia. In Singapore, its web traffic is three times higher than the two other largest solar companies combined. In the Philippines, where it is planning to expand within the next 12 months, its web traffic is five times more than the largest solar company. This helps keep its customer acquisition costs down. Chew says that over the past one and half years, Solar AI has spent very little on paid marketing, with about 80% of customer segments coming from organic search, including written content on Solar AI’s website and online tools like its instant solar assessment. Potential customers then go into Solar AI’s sales pipeline, where its salespeople have tools to give them a digital picture of the process and send them a proposal. This means the physical part of installing a solar system only comes once a customer has decided they are comfortable proceeding with either a five-year or 10-year plan. At that point, Solar AI goes to their property and does a site survey. The other 20% of customer segments comes through referrals. Other markets Solar AI plans to expand to include Malaysia and the Philippines, where it has already begun working with local partners. “Ultimately, the reason we built the company is to really try and hyper-scale rooftop solar, because we all believe that it’s one of the best climate solutions out there to decarbonize our environment,” Chew said. In a statement, Investible investment manager Ben Lindsay said, “There is a huge amount of untapped potential for both residential and commercial solar-as-a-service throughout Southeast Asia. The traction and robust pipeline Solar AI team have achieved to date is a strong indicator for their ability to be a leader throughout the region as its development continues to accelerate.”"
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/mrbeast-olympics-every-country-youtube-geopolitical-nightmare/,TechCrunch,MrBeast’s Olympics video is a geopolitical nightmare,"MrBeast stumbled into the heated discourse of global affairs in his latest stunt. The billionaire creator inadvertently stoked generations of geopolitical tension in his latest YouTube video, in which participants from “every country on Earth” competed in “Squid Game”-like elimination challenges for a chance to win $250,000. “Behind me is one person from every country on Earth,” MrBeast said in the video posted on Saturday. “We’re gonna see which country’s the best. Because I flew all of them here to compete in the most extreme version of the Olympics ever created.”  Like most of MrBeast’s content, the scale of the production was staggering. The competition involved massive obstacle courses over foam pits, an extravagant cash prize and a hefty dose of product placement. Those are pillars of MrBeast’s channel, and at this point, they aren’t novel enough to pique the attention of non-subscribers. It was the countries that weren’t included in the competition, as well as the map featured in the video, that made the stunt ripe for discourse. After each round, the map highlighted the countries that remained in the competition. Certain borders are already sources of major global conflict, and MrBeast appeared to take some divisive stances by depicting them on the map. X (formerly known as Twitter) users joked that the participants MrBeast flew in indicate the countries that he recognizes as sovereign. The video included a participant from Hong Kong, for example, but not Taiwan and Tibet, which were included in China’s borders. MrBeast appears to recognize American Samoa, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico as independent states, rather than territories of the United States and the United Kingdom. Kosovo and Somaliland are also depicted as sovereign nations. MrBeast recognizes Palestine, but only the West Bank. The map affirms the Sahrawi Republic’s claim over the disputed territory of Western Sahara, but also draws Morocco up to the de facto border, which conflicts with both countries’ claim over the land. MrBeast lumps Crimea in with Russia, which invaded and annexed the formerly Ukrainian peninsula in a move that was vehemently condemned by the United Nations. The map also gave Canada claim over island territories that are currently part of Greenland and Norway. Despite speculation that MrBeast supports Korean reunification, since only one participant was chosen to represent the peninsula, the map clearly depicts the border between North and South Korea. The flag of the American state of Georgia was used to represent the country of Georgia, which is less of a diplomatic stance and more of a comically myopic American mistake. The map also depicted Afghanistan using the black and white flag adopted by the Taliban in 2021, instead of the tricolor flag that was used until the Fall of Kabul. The United States and many other nations do not recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, and still use the tricolor flag to represent the country. Most of the depictions on the map are probably the result of limited research and sloppy editing instead of genuine stances MrBeast takes on wildly divisive international conflicts. But some viewers were deeply offended by the video’s implications. In an X post about the video, Ukrainian influencer Igor Lachenkov called on MrBeast to amend the map to show that he does not “support terrorism and war.” “You’ve invited a Russian onto your show to represent Russia, whereas global sports officials at least make them take part under a neutral flag,” Lachenkov wrote. “Ukrainians are in a full-scale war with Russia and have been fighting with the aggressor for their rights, freedom and lives.” MrBeast has not publicly responded to Lachenkov, or to any of the criticism of his apparent geopolitical takes. He has a habit of inciting heated debate over power and class with his content. Given his history of getting flamed for defending his videos — from pulling sweeping philanthropic stunts that do little to change systemic issues, to completely missing the point of the socioeconomic commentary in “Squid Game” — he’d be wise to keep quiet and avoid stumbling further into the thorny discourse. The phrase “MrBeast does not recognize Taiwan,” however, will haunt me for years."
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/elevenlabs-voice-generating-tools-launch-out-of-beta/,TechCrunch,ElevenLabs’ voice-generating tools launch out of beta,"ElevenLabs, the viral AI-powered platform for creating synthetic voices, today launched its platform out of beta with support for more than 30 languages. Using a new AI model developed in-house, ElevenLabs says that its tools are now capable of automatically identifying languages, including Korean, Dutch and Vietnamese, and generating “emotionally rich” speech in those languages. In combination with the new model, ElevenLabs customers can leverage the platform’s voice-cloning tool to speak across the almost 30 languages without first having to type text. “ElevenLabs was started with the dream of making all content universally accessible in any language and in any voice,” ElevenLabs CEO and co-cofounder Mati Staniszewski said in a statement. “With this release, we’re one step closer to making this dream a reality and making human-quality AI voices available in every dialect. Our text-to-speech generation tools help level the playing field and bring top quality spoken audio capabilities to all the creators out there.” Founded by Staniszewski, who previously worked at Palantir, and his childhood friend Piotr Dabkowski, an ex-Google employee, ElevenLabs has made headlines over the past few months for reasons both good and abhorrent. Inspired by the mediocre dubbing of American movies Staniszewski and Dabkowski watched growing up in Poland, the pair set about designing a platform that could do better — employing AI of course. ElevenLabs launched in beta in late January, and picked up steam rather quickly — owing to the high quality of its generated voices and generous free tier. But as alluded to earlier, the publicity hasn’t been consistently positive — particularly once bad actors exploited the platform for their own ends. The infamous message board 4chan, known for its conspiratorial content, used ElevenLabs’ tools to share hateful messages mimicking celebrities like actor Emma Watson. Elsewhere, The Verge’s James Vincent was able to tap ElevenLabs to clone targets’ voices in a matter of seconds, generating audio samples containing everything from threats of violence to expressions of racism and transphobia. In response, ElevenLabs said that it would introduce a set of new safeguards, like limiting voice cloning to paid accounts and providing a new AI detection tool. ElevenLabs has yet to grapple with the other controversy brewing around its platform and other platforms like it, though: their threat to the voice acting industry. Motherboard writes about how voice actors are increasingly being asked to sign away rights to their voices so that clients can use AI to generate synthetic versions that could eventually replace them. Meanwhile, internal emails seen by The New York Times indicate that Activision Blizzard, one of the biggest game publishers in the world, is working on tools for AI-assisted “voice cloning.” It would appear that ElevenLabs sees this as the natural progression of things, touting its work with publishers like Storytel; media platforms like TheSoul Publishing and MNTN for audiobooks and radio content; and publishers like Embark Studios and Paradox Interactive for video games, (Storytel and TheSoul Publishing are strategic investors). The company claims that it has more than a million registered users across the creative, entertainment and publishing spaces who’ve created 10 years’ worth of audio content."
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/twitch-disccovery-feed-test/,TechCrunch,Twitch starts testing a TikTok-like clips feed to boost discovery,"Twitch’s previously announced Discovery Feed is now out in the wild as a live test following the feature’s announcement back in July. The new feed will surface short clips from streams in a TikTok-like area within the Twitch app, giving offline creators a way to connect with new viewers without staying live for hours on end. The test is available now as a “limited experience,” so only a subset of Twitch’s base will be trying it out. The company says it will use the test period to train its algorithm and collect user feedback before a full release of Discovery Feed this fall.  Twitch creators can now select clips to be mixed into the new discovery feed and other “discovery surfaces” i.e. new corners of the site designed to funnel new viewers to channels they might like. Twitch will also throw some regular clips into the feed, but says that it will prioritize clips that a streamer chooses to feature (there’s no upward limit to how many you can choose) and eventually only use featured clips to maximize creator control. The Discovery Feed will join Twitch’s own take on a Stories feature, which is set to debut in October. The platform also recently added a tool that quickly exports vertical video for social sharing on apps like TikTok. (The new clips feed features horizontal video for now but Twitch says more vertical videos will appear “as the feed evolves.”) Twitch creators have long called on the company to build more features that help them build a following and reach new audiences. Unlike on a fully algorithmic platform like TikTok, Twitch streamers have relatively few ways to attract new followers and subscribers. Without a robust system for discovery akin to TikTok’s For You Page or YouTube’s recommendation engine, small and medium Twitch streamers often struggle to grow an audience without relying heavily on cross-platform promotion. The platform’s grind for building a regular viewership is infamous, and that isn’t even counting how difficult it is to earn meaningful income on the livestreaming platform. The more time Twitch streamers spend streaming, the better for Twitch, but the company ultimately knows that creator burnout and mental health are issues that could jeopardize the long-term health of the platform. While other social media sites encourage endless engagement and frequent posting, little compares to the demands of Twitch, where streamers regularly spend consecutive hours live each day in order to build and maintain a following. Twitch’s categories, which sort individual streamers by game and content type (Baldur’s Gate 3, Just Chatting, Music etc.), and its more recent addition of tags invite users to find new streamers, but they only aggregate anyone who is live at the time. That system incentivizes streamers to spend more time live to maximize their discovery chances and offers few avenues for offline streamers to connect with people who might enjoy their streams. “Because Twitch is all about live, interactive channels, it’s not our goal for viewers to spend hours in a Clips feed,” the company wrote in a blog post with the Discovery Feed announcement. “Our investment in Clips is to help viewers discover your channel so they join you and your community when you stream.”"
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/openai-brings-fine-tuning-to-gpt-3-5-turbo/,TechCrunch,OpenAI brings fine-tuning to GPT-3.5 Turbo,"OpenAI customers can now bring custom data to the lightweight version of GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5 Turbo — making it easier to improve the text-generating AI model’s reliability while building in specific behaviors. OpenAI claims that fine-tuned versions of GPT-3.5 can match or even outperform the base capabilities of GPT-4, the company’s flagship model, on “certain narrow tasks.” “Since the release of GPT-3.5 Turbo, developers and businesses have asked for the ability to customize the model to create unique and differentiated experiences for their users,” the company wrote in a blog post published this afternoon. “This update gives developers the ability to customize models that perform better for their use cases and run these custom models at scale.” With fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through OpenAI’s API can make the model better follow instructions, such as having it always respond in a given language. Or they can improve the model’s ability to consistently format responses (e.g. for completing snippets of code), as well as hone the “feel” of the model’s output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. In addition, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten their text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs. “Early testers have reduced prompt size by up to 90% by fine-tuning instructions into the model itself,” OpenAI claims in the blog post. Fine-tuning currently requires prepping data, uploading the necessary files and creating a fine-tuning job through OpenAI’s API. All fine-tuning data must pass through a “moderation” API and a GPT-4-powered moderation system to see if it’s in conflict with OpenAI’s safety standards, says the company. But OpenAI plans to launch a fine-tuning UI in the future with a dashboard for checking the status of ongoing fine-tuning workloads. Fine-tuning costs are as follows: “Tokens” represent raw text — e.g. “fan,” “tas” and “tic” for the word “fantastic.” A GPT-3.5-turbo fine-tuning job with a training file of 100,000 tokens, or about 75,000 words, would cost around $2.40, OpenAI says. In other news, OpenAI today made available two updated GPT-3 base models (babbage-002 and davinci-002), which can be fine-tuned as well, with support for pagination and “more extensibility.” As previously announced, OpenAI plans to retire the original GPT-3 base models on January 4, 2024. OpenAI said that fine-tuning support for GPT-4 — which, unlike GPT-3.5, can understand images in addition to text — will arrive sometime later this fall, but didn’t provide specifics beyond that."

Notably, this is only the first part of the film, which is titled “Rebel Moon Part 1: A Child of Fire.” Netflix is set to release a second part of the film, “Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver,” on April 19, 2024. The reason for the split is that the film would be approximately three hours in length, which Netflix film chairman Scott Stuber advised against; movies that are less than two hours perform better on the streamer, per Vanity Fair. “Rebel Moon” features “Kingsman: The Secret Service” actress Sofia Boutella as Kora, a mysterious warrior who defends a colony located on the edge of the galaxy that is threatened by Regent Balisarius (played by Ed Skrein) and the Mother World army. Kora recruits a small band of misfits from neighboring planets to help defeat the tyrannical ruling force.

2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/ibm-taps-ai-to-translate-cobol-code-to-java/,TechCrunch,IBM taps AI to translate COBOL code to Java,"COBOL, or Common Business Oriented Language, is one of the oldest programming languages in use, dating back to around 1959. It’s had surprising staying power; according to a 2022 survey, there’s over 800 billion lines of COBOL in use on production systems, up from an estimated 220 billion in 2017. But COBOL has a reputation for being a tough-to-navigate, inefficient language. Why not migrate to a newer one? For large organizations, it tends to be a complex and costly proposition, given the small number of COBOL experts in the world. When the Commonwealth Bank of Australia replaced its core COBOL platform in 2012, it took five years and cost over $700 million. Looking to present a new solution to the problem of modernizing COBOL apps, IBM today unveiled Code Assistant for IBM Z, which uses a code-generating AI model to translate COBOL code into Java. Set to become generally available in Q4 2023, Code Assistant for IBM Z will enter preview during IBM’s TechXchange conference in Las Vegas early this September. Code Assistant for IBM Z is designed to assist businesses in refactoring their mainframe apps, ideally while preserving performance and security, according to IBM Research chief scientist Ruchir Puri. Running locally in an on-premises configuration or in the cloud as a managed service, Code Assistant is powered by a code-generating model, CodeNet, that can understand not only COBOL and Java but also around 80 different programming languages. “IBM built a new, state-of-the-art generative AI code model to transform legacy COBOL programs to enterprise Java with a high degree of naturalness in the generated code,” Puri told TechCrunch in an email interview. “In addition to code transformation, Code Assistant supports the complete application modernization life cycle and helps developers understand, refactor, transform and validate the translated code in a modern architecture.” Puri says that CodeNet, which was trained with 1.5 trillion tokens and has 20 billion parameters, was engineered with a large context window — 32,000 tokens — to “capture the broader context” for “more efficient COBOL to Java transformation.” Parameters are the parts of a model learned from historical training data and essentially define the skill of the model on a problem, such as generating text, while tokens represent raw text (e.g. “fan,” “tas” and “tic” for the word “fantastic”). As for context window, it refers to the text the model considers before generating additional text. There’s a number of tools, apps and services to convert COBOL apps to Java syntax today, some of which are entirely automated. Puri acknowledges this but makes the case that Code Assistant takes steps to avoid sacrificing COBOL’s capabilities while delivering on reducing costs and producing code that’s easy to maintain — unlike some of the rival offerings on the market. “IBM built the Code Assistant for IBM Z to be able to mix and match COBOL and Java services,” Puri said. “If the ‘understand’ and ‘refactor’ capabilities of the system recommend that a given sub-service of the application needs to stay in COBOL, it’ll be kept that way, and the other sub-services will be transformed into Java.” That’s not to suggest that Code Assistant is flawless. A recent Stanford study finds that software engineers who use code-generating AI systems similar to it are more likely to cause vulnerabilities in the apps they develop. Indeed, Puri cautions against deploying code produced by Code Assistant before having it reviewed by human experts. “Like any AI system, there might be unique usage patterns of an enterprise’s COBOL application that Code Assistant for IBM Z may not have mastered yet,” Puri said. “It’s essential that the code is scanned with state-of-the-art vulnerability scanners to ensure code security.” Risks aside, IBM no doubt sees tools like Code Assistant as important to its future growth. Today, about 84% of IBM’s mainframe customers run COBOL — mostly customers in the financial and government sectors. And while IBM’s mainframe division is still a large portion of its overall business, the company views the mainframe as a bridge to the expansive, lucrative hybrid computing environments that it also hosts and facilitates. IBM sees a future in broader code-generating AI tools, as well — intent on competing with apps like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer. In May, IBM launched fm.model.code within its Watsonx AI service, which powers Watson Code Assistant, allowing developers to generate code using plain English prompts across programs, including Red Hat’s Ansible Lightspeed."

Editorial Manager, TechCrunch+ Image Credits: Image Source (opens in a new window) / Getty Images Generative AI often looks like a magic trick, but complex prompts can consume a great deal of resources. And that makes usage-based pricing a “natural fit” for SaaS companies adding AI-powered products to their roster, says Puneet Gupta, a former AWS general manager who’s now the CEO and co-founder of Amberflo.io. “Since the back-end costs of providing service are inherently variable, the customer-facing billing should be usage-based as well.” Image Credits: Bryce Durbin Tech is set on disrupting nearly every aspect of human existence.

2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/microsoft-cant-stop-discontinuing-kinect/,TechCrunch,Microsoft can’t stop discontinuing Kinect,"Kinect occupies a strange place in the tech world. It’s a nearly universally beloved piece of technology that was both ahead of its time and very much of its time, all at once. It felt — for a moment — like it was going to revolutionize gaming, but much like the Wii, proved to be — at least temporarily — an evolutionary dead end. In 2013, Apple purchased PrimeSense, the Israeli startup behind the Kinect technology, using it as the foundation for iOS’s Face ID. This wasn’t, however, the end of Kinect. The peripheral build up provided a second life among DIYers. A low-cost, widely available stereoscopic camera was an immensely powerful tool that unlocked genuinely exciting technology. The 3D camera kit has also become a mainstay in research labs for the past decades. I can’t tell you how many robotics projects I’ve seen that rely on the tech. The Kinect for Xbox One was discontinued in 2017. But Microsoft granted the hardware another chance two years later, this time as a development tool. The Azure Kinect Developer Kit embraced exactly what the gaming peripheral had informally become. Image Credits: Microsoft “Project Kinect for Azure unlocks countless new opportunities to take advantage of Machine Learning, Cognitive Services and IoT Edge,” the company wrote at the time. “We envision that Project Kinect for Azure will result in new AI solutions from Microsoft and our ecosystem of partners, built on the growing range of sensors integrating with Azure AI services.” But that, too, shall pass. Microsoft announced last week that it has “made the decision to end production of Azure Kinect Developer Kit.” The company says it will continue to support the developer kit, while pointing interested parties in the direction of Michigan-based firm Orbbec. The company produces the Femto time of flight 3D camera, which also offers an SDK for developers. “This week, Orbbec launched the Femto Bolt,” Microsoft notes. “The product is a partner option that customers who are interested in a solution like Azure Kinect Developer Kit can consider. Orbbec’s camera offerings use the same depth camera module as Azure Kinect Developer Kit, and developers can migrate their existing applications using Azure Kinect Developer Kit to Orbbec’s cameras using the API bridge provided as part of their SDK.”"
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/poltchageist-matcha-pokemon/,TechCrunch,They made a scary matcha Pokémon,"A new Pokémon just dropped, and it’s literally a chipped teapot of matcha. It is called Poltchageist, and yes, that’s a portmanteau of “poltergeist” and “matcha.” It’s ghost tea. Yes, Pokémon has already made this joke before, when they introduced Polteageist in the Pokémon Sword and Shield games, which take place in the Britain-inspired Galar region. But of course, the British aren’t the only ones who love tea — the preparation of matcha is a centuries-old cultural ritual in Japan. So, when the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC takes us to the Japanese-inspired Kitakami region, why wouldn’t we encounter . . . sentient, haunted matcha? Per Poltchageist’s Pokédex description: Image Credits: The Pokémon Company As if life-sucking matcha isn’t creepy enough, the Pokémon Company released a video about the legend of this Pokémon, which is apparently told as a spooky story to local youth. So, there once was a tea master who was so committed to perfecting the art of the tea ceremony that no one wanted to hang out with him anymore, because he was constantly yelling at everyone about raising their tea bowls too high, or talking while making tea. He then died while saying, “Regret is a bitter sip!” which are some pretty hardcore last words. This grumpy old tea master’s tea caddy was passed down from generation to generation, but then it came back to life as a grass and ghost type Pokémon. It flew away to haunt grumpy tea drinkers, then murdered a woman with its matcha powder for texting at the table? Now, according to Pokémon lore (which is consistently this bonkers), parents tell their kids in the Kitakami region that if they don’t finish their food, they will face the wrath of Poltchageist. We’ll have to see what new Pokémon horrors await us in this supposed children’s game when the first part of the Scarlet and Violet DLC, The Teal Mask, comes out on September 13. At least Cramorant is coming back. "
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/ibm-sells-the-weather-company-assets-to-francisco-partners/,TechCrunch,IBM sells The Weather Company assets to Francisco Partners,"Following rumors that it was exploring the sale of its weather business as part of a move to streamline operations, IBM says that it’s found a buyer for The Weather Company, the weather forecasting and information company it acquired in 2015. Francisco Partners, the private equity firm, has signed a definitive agreement to acquire The Weather Company assets from IBM, the two companies announced today. The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, save that it’s expected to close by the end of Q1 2024 — subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, of course. As a part of the acquisition, Francisco Partners will get The Weather Company’s consumer-facing apps, including The Weather Channel mobile, Weather.com, Weather Underground and Storm Radar, plus The Weather Company’s enterprise offerings for broadcast, media, aviation, adtech and “data solutions.” In addition, The Weather Company will bring its forecasting science services to Francisco Partners, IBM says, as well as its tech platform. As for IBM, it’ll retain The Weather Channel’s sustainability software business post-purchase — namely its “environmental intelligence suite” for ESG reporting. And it’ll continue to use The Weather Company’s weather data for “climate-related use cases” like the geospatial AI model it offers in Watsonx, its AI and data platform “We’re proud of what The Weather Company team has accomplished with IBM, and we’re confident that the best path forward is as a standalone company benefiting from Francisco Partners’ expanded investment, dedication and expertise,” Rob Thomas, SVP of software and chief commercial officer at IBM, said in a press release. “Over the last few years, we’ve evolved IBM to be a hybrid cloud and AI company. We regularly review our portfolio to make sure our business areas are core to that strategy, and today’s news reflects our continued focus on these two transformational technologies.” When IBM purchased The Weather Company for $2 billion, it pitched the move as a major long-term analytics, big data and internet of things play. To wit, over roughly eight years, IBM has launched a number of new apps and services on top of The Weather Company’s properties, including hyperlocal forecasts, COVID-19 maps and enhanced weather forecasts leveraging data from aircraft and smartphones. Under IBM’s management, The Weather Company, founded in 1980 as The Weather Channel, grew to serve an average of more than 415 million people each month on its consumer-facing properties and over 2,000 businesses through its enterprise products. But IBM, which in June spent $4.6 billion to acquire Apptio, the business spend and value management platform, is under pressure to turn its financials around. In its most recent fiscal quarter, IBM generated revenue of around $15.5 billion, down 0.4% from its year-ago result. The company’s mainframe business alone fell 30%, while its infrastructure business declined to $3.6 billion, down 14.6%. Facing its lowest share price in over 20 years, IBM is laying off staff, in March announcing plans to cut its headcount by 3,900 people — concentrated mostly in its Watson AI division and Kyndryl managed infrastructure business. IBM also recently sold Watson Health to Francisco Partners, a deal reportedly in the $1 billion range. (Some reports suggest IBM was seeking a similar price tag for The Weather Company.) Francisco Partners sees a bright future in The Weather Company, saying it plans to increase investment and resources in the platform to take it “beyond forecasting alone” with “new tools and experiences” focused on health and well-being. On the business side, The Weather Company will offer “more actionable insights,” Francisco Partners says, alongside “real-time experiences” aimed at ad and subscription media companies. “Amid the growing volatility of weather, The Weather Company’s unique set of consumer, media and industry-specific products provide mission critical, data-driven weather insights to individuals and businesses around the world,” Alan Ni, partner at Francisco Partners, said in a canned statement. “We’re excited to partner with the management team to grow The Weather Company’s robust portfolio of technology offerings and deliver a great product experience for its customers.” There’s no denying that weather forecasting is a lucrative business. A National Weather Service survey from 2012 pegs the total value of weather data that could be captured across all industries in the U.S. in the range of $13 billion. The private weather forecasting market, meanwhile, is expected to grow from $1.76 billion in value in 2022 to $4.18 billion in 2030, according to a report from Verified Market Research."
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/get-rid-of-tech-debt/,TechCrunch,Chronic technical debt could be holding your company back,"We’ve been hearing about digital transformation for over a decade now, the idea that you have to modernize your systems for a more digitally centric world. What holds back digital transformation? Well, lots of things, from office politics to budget prioritization to inertia, but one big factor preventing companies from taking advantage of the latest technology could be the age of their tech stack. Companies steeped in another concept known as technical debt — a growing cost for not fixing structural problems in tech systems — could be limiting their ability to take advantage of newer technologies. And at some point, the cost of that debt could become so high, companies could be left in the dust altogether. In the last 15 years, we’ve seen a number of meaningful technological shifts from mobile to cloud to containerization. If these waves passed you by, and you’re stuck on ancient systems, be prepared for your company’s future digital transformation journey to potentially be long and painful. We spoke to David Linthicum, chief cloud strategy officer at Deloitte and author of the book “An Insider’s Guide to Cloud Computing,” about the issue of overcoming technical debt. Linthicum has been helping companies move to the cloud for years now, and he has a dire message for firms stuck on older systems. One thing we know about large enterprises is they typically move methodically. They have systems in place, like legal, compliance, security and HR, all built to say no in order to protect the company from changing too quickly. While nobody is suggesting that large companies suddenly start “moving fast and breaking things,” it may be time to pick up the pace or risk getting left behind. "
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/landing-platform-virtual-mood-boards-creation-tools-mobile/,TechCrunch,"Landing, a platform for making virtual mood boards, brings its creation tools to mobile","Landing, the community-powered social platform where users create and publish virtual mood boards and collages, today launched a mobile feature called “Creation,” allowing users to express their creativity on the go. Previously only available on the web app, Creation is arguably the most popular tool amongst Landing’s 275,000+ users since it lets them create mood boards from scratch, add shoppable links, access the community library of over 4.5 million images, upload their own images, as well as use other basic editing capabilities like rotate, undo, redo, delete, layering and more. Landing launched its iOS app in March, which only let mobile users create simple grids with five images and had no way of rotating assets or moving them around besides a shuffle button that randomly organized them. Now, they can add as many images as they want and manipulate items to their heart’s content; users are able to pinch the screen to make an image look smaller or larger, move an item underneath another one, and so forth. Users can also change the background and add visual design elements, such as text, shapes and icons. Image Credits: Landing “The most hardcore feedback we’ve gotten from our community over the last year is that they desperately want this flexible, creative tool on mobile,” co-founder Ellie Buckingham told TechCrunch. Buckingham added that because Landing wanted to push out the feature as quickly as possible, it will only have the “basic tooling” at launch rather than the full functionality that exists on the web. For instance, mobile users are unable to upload images or add shoppable links to mood boards — two helpful features for small businesses and brands looking to promote their products on the platform. Landing plans to update the feature soon. However, she also noted that Creation is a cross-platform tool, meaning users can add images to the platform via the web app and then use them on mobile. There’s also an option to save a mood board in drafts, so users who want to make their content on the go can wait until they have access to the web to add their shoppable link. Currently, the Creation feature is only available on iOS devices and desktops. Landing recently launched its beta app in the Google Play Store a few weeks ago; however, the company plans to test Creation on iOS first before rolling it out to Android devices. Image Credits: Landing Mobile users may have also noticed a ChatGPT feature in Creation called “GlitterBot,” which generates daily horoscopes or an inspirational snapshot of the day. For instance, it will say things like “Hey there, shimmering soul! Today’s cosmic tides splash you with endless joy and a vibrant zest for life.” Essentially, it’s a poetic description that users can post alongside their mood board. GlitterBot is currently in beta. Landing says it also leverages AI as a “creative sidekick” through image tagging and image recommendations. Founded by Buckingham and Miri Buckland, Landing initially launched in 2021 as a home design platform but evolved into a collage maker for Gen Z. The platform has a similar vibe to Pinterest’s Shuffles app and the now-defunct Polyvore, allowing users to be inspired and tap into their self-expression. There are tons of possibilities on Landing, like using it as an aesthetically pleasing visual diary, planning out outfits, or creating presentation slides, graphics for social media, virtual vision boards and more. Users can also chat with other users via the community spaces tab."
2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/chandrayaan-3-landing-moon-live/,TechCrunch,Watch India’s Chandrayaan-3 moon landing live," Chandrayaan-3, India’s latest mission to the moon, is set to undertake its key final stage today as the unmanned spacecraft attempts a soft landing on the lunar surface — 40 days after its launch from the southern part of the South Asian nation. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will livestream the launch that will begin at 4:50 am PT on August 23 (5:20 pm IST), more than half an hour before the targeted landing time of 5:34 am PT (6:04pm IST). On Tuesday, ISRO confirmed that the mission was on schedule and said the systems were undergoing regular checks, and smooth sailing continued. Launched in July through ISRO’s Launch Vehicle Mark-3 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in South India’s Sriharikota island, Chandrayaan-3 is India’s third lunar mission. It aims to land on the lunar south pole, far from the side facing the Earth. It is believed that this region may hold essential secrets about the moon, including the potential existence of frozen water that could help support human habitation on the natural satellite and could potentially be used as fuel for future missions to distant locations. The Chandrayaan-3 mission is the follow-up to the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, which crashed before landing on the moon in 2019. The Indian space agency has made a number of improvements in the Chandrayaan-3 lander to handle additional dispersion, as well as included updated sensors and integrated improved software and propulsion systems to minimize the chances of any failures this time. Apart from the lander, the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft includes a propulsion module and a rover. The latter is identical to that of Chandrayaan-2. The spacecraft includes sensors such as a seismometer, thermal probe, X-ray and laser spectrometer. It also carries a retroflector from NASA. Earlier this week, ISRO shared images of the moon’s far side taken by the Chandrayaan-3 lander called Vikram. The Chandrayaan-2 orbiter, which is orbiting the moon and will assist in connecting the Chandrayaan-3 rover with the Earth’s space station, also recently communicated with the new spacecraft’s lander. Should Chandrayaan-3 be successful, India will become the first country to land on the lunar south pole. The mission’s success will also make the country the fourth to achieve a soft landing on the moon, following the United States, former Soviet Union and China. Earlier this month, Russia attempted to take on India by launching its moon landing spacecraft Luna-25. The Russian spacecraft, however, collided onto the moon’s surface after losing control on Saturday."

2023-08-22,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/grieving-widow-sues-tesla-over-deadly-model-3-crash-and-explosion/,TechCrunch,Grieving widow sues Tesla over deadly Model 3 crash and explosion,"A grieving widow is suing Tesla after her husband’s 2020 Model 3 crashed and exploded, causing a fire that resulted in his death. The plaintiff, Jiyoung Yoon, claims Tesla played a role in designing, manufacturing, distributing and selling her husband’s car in its “defective and unreasonably dangerous condition,” which ultimately caused his death, according to a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. Jyung Woo Hahn, 46, was driving his Tesla on the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Rockland County, New York, on March 12, 2022 when the vehicle malfunctioned and collided with a tree and immediately burst into flames. Yoon claims her husband survived the initial crash, but was trapped in the fast-burning vehicle. Images of the wreck show a charred shell of a vehicle. Nanuet firefighters who responded to the crash said the fire was “extremely difficult” to put out after the car’s lithium-ion battery burst into flames, per a report from The Daily Voice. When a lithium-ion battery is ruptured, a process called thermal runaway happens, which results in a sharp increase of battery cell temperature and pressure, accompanied by the release of flammable gas. The flammable gas can ignite from the battery’s high temperature, resulting in a quick fire that’s hard to put out and emits toxic fumes. Tesla’s batteries span the entire length and width of the floor of its vehicles, making a fire that much more encompassing. Firefighters used more than 1,000 gallons of water to extinguish the fire. Yoon alleges that Tesla is strictly liable for her husband’s death. She accuses the automaker of making a vehicle that is defective in its design and manufacture, and is not crashworthy. Yoon also alleges that Tesla is guilty of negligence and breach of implied warranty of merchantability. The plaintiff demands a jury trial and is asking for all damages recoverable by law, including actual damages, lost wages and earning capacity, loss of parental guidance, emotional distress, punitive damages and more. There have been a range of fires in recent years started by Tesla crashes, due to the flammable nature of lithium-ion batteries. In July, a Tesla crashed into a home in New York, causing a fire that killed two people. That same month, another Tesla crashed into an elementary school parking lot in California, causing the car to burst into flames. TechCrunch has reached out to the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration to determine if the agency is investigating fires related to Tesla crashes. NHTSA is currently investigating Tesla over loss of power steering control, and the agency has opened dozens of special crash investigations into Tesla vehicles where Autopilot (Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system) was suspected of being used before a crash."
2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/accure-series-a-battery-fires/,TechCrunch,One company’s quest to eliminate battery fires,"Battery fires are bad. Just ask LG, GM, Tesla, Volkswagen or any of the hundreds of people whose e-bikes have caught fire. While fires caused by EVs are a relative rarity compared with fossil fuel vehicles, that doesn’t mean they’re not dangerous. But there’s something that batteries have that fossil fuels don’t: the ability to monitor themselves. “Every lithium-ion battery is an IoT device,” Accure co-founder and CEO Kai-Philipp Kairies told TechCrunch+. “All of these batteries are generating heaps of data.” Batteries are going to be everywhere in the next couple decades, reshaping everything from cars and trucks to toys, home furnishings and more, all things that people interact with on a daily basis. The potential for fires could increase as adoption grows, but it doesn’t have to. All that data that batteries are generating gives us a window into how they’re operating. It also gives us a chance to predict when they’ll go haywire. Kairies and his co-founders started Accure with an eye toward minimizing battery fires, taking problematic cells out of service before they pose a hazard. The team creates a digital twin of the batteries it monitors, starting with models based on the physical properties of the specific chemistry and construction and blending in artificial intelligence to aid in predictions. “We’re using the sensors and we’re dissecting the signals into what are the underlying properties causing the signals. Then we use prediction mechanisms for the underlying behaviors. And from there, we can use a model again to say, what is this leading toward?” he said. “As far as I know, we’re the only company that has consistently been able to correctly predict thermal runaway in a battery days and weeks before it happens,” he said. “We can’t guarantee 100%. That’s just not possible. But we can substantially reduce the fire risk of a battery.” The company announced Tuesday that it has raised 7.2 million euros in a Series A2 led by Blue Bear Capital and HSBC Asset Management with participation from Riverstone Holdings and Capnamic Ventures.

2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/dipp/,TechCrunch,Dipp uses AI to fix bottlenecks between marketing and design teams,"Before founding dipp, Jennifer Chen and Mikhail Abramov spent 15 years working as art directors in New York City. During that time, Chen says they realized that the marketing, sales and design process has stayed the same, despite new technology and tools being introduced to the market, and is often riddled with bottlenecks. “Salespeople have sales needs, they communicate with the marketing team and then once the marketing team has a direction, they brief a designer, then the designer goes back to the marketer, and then the marketer goes back to the designer,” she said. “There’s that vicious cycle that slows down the entire process because nobody understands the needs and workflow of the other department.” Dipp was launched three years ago to automate much of that workflow and allow marketing and design teams to collaborate more effectively, while focusing on their own performance metrics. For example, if a marketing team wants to update a price on their ad, all they need to do is enter it into a spreadsheet instead of asking a designer. The Taipei-based startup recently raised $1.5 million in seed funding from investors, including SparkLabs Taiwan, Palm Drive Capital and content-tech unicorn Tezign, and will launch generative AI–powered features soon. To use dipp, brands first set up a brand guideline with information such as fonts, colors and layout (or they can upload an Adobe Photoshop file). That data is then turned into a dipp file with everything remaining editable. Then prices and other information for ads are uploaded into a spreadsheet, with each row representing a product, so visual assets can be edited in batches. This helps marketing and design teams keep up with the massive amount of visual content that is needed to sell online — Chen said brands typically generate 300 to 500 images at a time, which dipp can help them do in minutes. Dipp’s team. Image Credits: dipp The brands dipp works with are typically Fortune 500 companies in apparel and beauty selling a large number of products, or upward of 500 SKUs. They have high product rotation rates, often with weekly launches of 20 or more products, and sell on three or more marketplaces, alongside social media advertising campaigns. Chen says most have large sales and marketing teams, but a shortage of designers. Its customers include Levi’s, Estée Lauder and Rakuten. Dipp also works with e-commerce enablers, or agencies that help brands distribute products across multiple channels. Since its launch, dipp has primarily focused on Taiwan but is expanding into Southeast Asia, with new clients in Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand. Dipp started in New York, but the team decided to move to Taiwan after getting into Taipei-based accelerator AppWorks because of the market potential it saw in Asia. For example, brands here hold a high number of sales promotions. “Throughout the year, it’s not just Black Friday or Christmas; there’s a sale every month,” Chen said. “There’s a busy season starting in June that goes all the way to Chinese New Year.” In terms of competition, Chen says potential customers often ask how dipp is different from Rocketium, which helps creative teams build very large marketing campaigns. Chen says dipp differentiates by focusing on e-commerce because brands in Asia often sell through multiple online channels at the same time, including PC Home, Momo, Shopee and Lazada. Each marketplace has its own unique guidelines for visual content, including file sizes and dimensions. That information is embedded into dipp’s platform, so brands can automate their ads to fit different requirements. Dipp is now working on integrating generative AI into its platform to help address gaps between marketing and design departments. For example, it will allow marketers to use prompts to generate images as a first draft of ideas to present to designers. It also automates the process of reviewing designs, or checking details like character limit and formatting to meet the requirements of different marketplaces and social media platforms. Dipp’s new funding will be used for team expansion, especially in its R&D and business departments. In a statement, Palm Drive Capital founding partner Seamon Chan said, “With global venture capital investments in generative AI reaching US$1.7 billion in the first quarter of this year, we are thrilled to support dipp in enhancing their e-commerce solution with AI capabilities. As the company has validated its value proposition in Taiwan by offering a much-needed solution to the multichannel e-commerce operation of global brands, we are optimistic that this solution will bring disruptive impact on e-commerce operating workflows through the APAC region.”"
2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/chip-company-arm-files-for-nasdaq-listing-in-ipo-anticipated-to-be-this-years-biggest/,TechCrunch,Chip company Arm files for Nasdaq listing in IPO anticipated to be this year’s biggest,"Arm, the U.K.-based chipmaker owned by Japan’s SoftBank since 2016, has filed for a Nasdaq listing five months after announcing it had filed confidential, preliminary IPO paperwork with U.S. regulators. The outfit didn’t provide a projected share price in its F-1 paperwork, but SoftBank recently bought the 24.99% stake in Arm that it didn’t own outright from its Vision Fund unit, reportedly at a valuation of more than $64 billion. That’s twice the $32 billion SoftBank paid for Arm seven years ago. (The Vision Fund has outside limited partners, including the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi; SoftBank sold that stake in Arm to the Vision Fund in 2017 for $8 billion.) SoftBank has paid a steep price for marking up its own deals in the past. Most famously, SoftBank plowed $4.4 billion into the co-working company WeWork in the summer of 2017 when it was still privately held, at a reported valuation of $20 billion. SoftBank invested in WeWork again in early 2019 at a $47 billion valuation. At the time, SoftBank had invested roughly $10.5 billion into WeWork both directly and via its Vision Fund arm. It went on to invest even more in the company and to lose nearly its entire investment. Arm has long developed and licensed what it describes as high-performance, low-cost, and energy-efficient central processing unit (CPU) products and related technology, on which many of the world’s leading semiconductor companies and OEMs rely to develop their products. Among customers of the roughly 6,000-person company are Apple, Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and Mercedes-Benz. Analysts expect Arm’s IPO to be the biggest of 2023, though not everyone agrees that the company is worth what SoftBank thinks it’s worth. Late last month, Bernstein analysts assessed Arm’s fair-market value to be about $40 billion based on its preliminary analysis of the limited financial information that was available at the time. It isn’t clear as of this writing whether Bernstein will revise that estimate based on the financial formation provided in Arm’s F-1, including reported net income of $524 million on $2.68 billion in revenue in its fiscal 2023, which ended in March, which is almost exactly what it generated in 2022 sales ($2.7 billion). What is known: Arm agreed to sell itself in 2020 for $40 billion in cash and stock to the dominant maker of chips for AI, Nvidia — a deal that could have proved highly lucrative for SoftBank given the run-up in Nvidia’s stock this year. But the deal was called off in February 2022, owing to “significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction.” Plans for an IPO began coming together immediately afterward. Founded in 1990, Arm began as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple, and VLSI Technology and was publicly listed on both the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq from 1998 until SoftBank took the company private. In its F-1, Arm lists 22 concerns as “risk factors,” including that customers “may decide to license our architecture and develop their own processors based on our architecture, rather than utilize our processor products pursuant to an implementation license.” Partly to head off that risk, Arm has more recently begun building its own advanced semiconductors as first reported in April by the Financial Times."

Per Triller’s S-1 filing, the short-form video app has had 550 million lifetime sign-ups. But market intelligence firm Apptopia estimates that Triller has been downloaded just 73.2 million times since launch in 2015 — that’s 87% lower than Triller’s own reports. Apptopia’s data is only inclusive of mobile app installs, which means if Triller’s numbers are correct, the remaining deficit would have to come via web sign-ups. Apptopia, a popular source for app analytics, says that its estimates are 70% to 90% accurate, on average. The company has hundreds of clients, including Visa, Andreessen Horowitz, Coca-Cola, Target, Zoom and others. Reached for comment, Triller maintains its numbers are accurate. But this isn’t the first time its own numbers have come into question. Image Credits: Apptopia When Triller attempted to go public via SPAC in 2021, Billboard reported that the company claimed higher user numbers to the public than it did to music rights holders. In a December 2019 press release, Triller said it had 26.5 million monthly active users, though sources told Billboard that its user base was actually half the size; then, when Triller said it had 50 million monthly active users, Billboard’s sources said this number was actually closer to 25 million. Triller CEO Mike Lu said at the time that “there is no legal definition of MAU/DAU.” (MAU and DAU are standard industry metrics used to measure an app’s monthly or daily active users.) “Triller’s value is in monetizing users, not MAU or DAU. In the past, the press has had a hard time understanding this,” he told Billboard. On the Google Play store, Triller’s download numbers also look relatively low. Google Play indicates that Triller has over 10 million downloads. This could mean that the app has been downloaded anywhere between 10 and 50 million times (Google Play has badges for 10+ million downloads and 50+ million, but no designations in between). Triller has had several more bizarre legal dalliances throughout its existence, beyond just debates over user numbers. In the last few years, Triller faced individual legal actions from Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Timbaland and Swizz Beatz, all of whom accused Triller of owing them millions of dollars in missed payments. In the case of the UMG dispute, Lu described it as “a bad ‘Punk’d’ episode.” The company was also found in a Washington Post report to have missed many payments to creators in a Triller incubator program. Image Credits: Apptopia Apptopia’s estimates also found that users spend, on average, about 11 minutes per month per device on Triller. Triller didn’t confirm the figure, but a spokesperson told TechCrunch that it “is not something that has any relevance to our business model.” Per its S-1, Triller earned $47.7 million in revenue in 2022, but it has lost money each year it’s operated. The company lost $195.6 million last year, and in 2021, it lost $773.6 million."
2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/teeny-ev-startup-arcimoto-defense-contractor-matbock/,TechCrunch,Teeny EV startup Arcimoto hooks up with defense contractor,"What happens when a maker of tiny electric vehicles dips its wheels into the military industrial complex? We’re about to find out. On Monday, Arcimoto said it is diversifying beyond its usual business via a partnership with Department of Defense contractor Matbock. That’s a first for the EV startup, which is best known for its doorless “fun utility vehicles.” The company also makes an “e-trike” and some commercial vehicles, including this impossibly small box truck (in the loosest sense) and an EV for paramedics. In addition to all that, Arcimoto said in a statement that it will sell “electrical systems architecture and energy storage systems” to Matbock, which makes “hybrid-electric tactical vehicles.” Matbock also sells hunting gear, camo travel bags and an apparel line that might appeal to someone like Volodymyr Zelensky. The deal may seem out of nowhere for Arcimoto, which has focused on things like supplying vehicles for scenic tours, but it’s apparently not much of a departure for the company’s latest CEO, Chris Dawson. The executive told TechCrunch in April that he had previously consulted with the Department of Defense. According to Dawson, the Matbock deal will ultimately “assist the military’s efforts to improve tactical capabilities and operational efficiencies through the adoption of American-made green energy technology.” The U.S. military is among the planet’s worst climate polluters. Researchers argue that the military must shrink in order to meaningfully decarbonize. For its part, Arcimoto is searching for ways to keep its doors open. The company kicked off the year with a warning that it had “substantial doubt about [its] ability to continue” operating. Since then, the firm says it’s secured nearly $25 million via three separate fundraises — including a $6.7 million offering earlier this month. Arcimoto is due to share its latest financials with investors on August 24."

After toying with some AI-powered features on Tinder, Match Group is taking things to the next level by appointing former Zynga head of growth Mark Kantor as vice president of innovation. Kantor, who also co-founded startups like Yellowbrick and Graffiti, will lead a small team of engineers and designers focused on bringing new technologies to Match Group’s apps. “Harnessing our emerging generative AI solutions will be one key focus area, as we explore ways to make it easier for users to engage in dating apps, provide tools to help users showcase their individuality, and further enhance the safety and accessibility of our apps,” wrote CTO Will Wu in an internal memo, which was provided to TechCrunch. Match Group is calling Kantor’s team ASL, which stands for “Art x Science Lab” and is a nod to the retro internet pickup line, “ASL?” (age, sex, location). Match has already begun working on some AI tools. Recently, Tinder announced it would test an AI photo selection feature, which looks at users’ photo albums to pick the photos that would perform best on the app. At a Reuters event last month, Tinder CPO Mark Van Ryswyk hinted at the idea that users could write their dating bios with generative AI . . . which may sound kind of icky, but then again, people are writing wedding vows on ChatGPT, so it seems some people are into that. The idea of AI-powered dating might feel concerning for consumers who want their online dating experiences to feel as authentic as possible. But Match Group is trying to make sure that its innovations don’t come across as too disingenuous. “It’s imperative that our features and tools enhance trust, authenticity and respect and, ultimately, lead to better matches and dates in real life,” CEO Bernard Kim said on Match Group’s last earnings call. “By the end of the year, we expect to have launched a number of initiatives that will use generative AI to eliminate awkwardness, make dating more rewarding and surprise and delight users, all in a way that focuses on authenticity and maintaining the highest ethical and privacy standards.”"

But can it convert all the early hype to meaningful, lasting traction? The app, built on Coinbase’s layer-2 blockchain Base, allows users to tokenize their likeness by selling “shares” of themselves to their followers, who then become shareholders and can message the users directly. The app was quickly picked up and popularized by “Crypto Twitter” personalities like Frank DeGods and gainzy222, trading influencer RookieXBT, and NBA player Grayson Allen, to name a few. Since its launch, Friend.tech has seen total volume of 33,596 ether, or about $55.5 million, across 1.29 million transactions, according to Dune analytics data from Michael Silberling, a data analyst at OP Labs. (Disclosure: Silberling is a sibling of Amanda Silberling, a TechCrunch reporter.) In the past 24 hours, the platform has brought in $1.42 million in fees and $709,839 in revenue, making it the third-largest fee and revenue generator in the entirety of crypto during that time frame, only trailing the Ethereum blockchain itself and staking service Lido, according to DefiLlama data. The platform charges a total of 10% in fees per transaction, with 5% going to Friend.tech and the other 5% going to the account holder. But despite the app’s significant early traction, many people are skeptical about its viability due to its lack of a privacy policy, the requirement to deposit ether upon signing up, a reportedly laggy interface, and an unclear roadmap. While the app does allow those profiting from the shares to cash out, there’s little clarity on the security measures in place, the liquidity structure and other aspects of its operations. Friend.tech is also arguably a newer take of a slightly more controversial attempt by BitClout (later rebranded to DeSo). A crypto social network that let people buy and sell tokens based on people’s reputations, DeSo launched in 2021 to much hype. But traction eventually fizzled, and the app got into legal trouble for preloading users onto its platform without their permission. "
2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/snapchat-is-expanding-further-into-generative-ai-with-dreams/,TechCrunch,Snapchat is expanding further into generative AI with ‘Dreams’,"Snapchat is preparing to further expand into generative AI features, after earlier launching its AI-powered chatbot My AI, which can now respond with a Snap back, not just text. With the company’s forthcoming generative AI feature called “Dreams,” Snap will again experiment with AI images — but soon, those images may contain you and your friends in imaginative backgrounds. The company has been developing features that allow Snapchat users to take or upload selfies that will allow the app to generate new pictures of you in scenarios you imagine, according to findings from app researcher and developer Steve Moser. This sounds similar to what other AI photo apps on the App Store already offer. One in particular — an app called Remini — went viral last month as TikTok users realized they could upload their selfies in order to receive professional-looking headshots for LinkedIn without having to pay for a pro photo shoot. Snapchat is not likely interested in boring headshots, though. Instead, it imagines Dreams as a way to use AI-generated selfies to place pictures of you in “fantastical places and scenarios,” Moser’s research indicates. Like other AI selfie apps, Snapchat would need clear selfies to work with — not ones where your features are obstructed or those with other people in them. Having a variety of angles, expressions, and lighting conditions will also result in better AI photos, the app will instruct users. In addition to putting yourself into these AI “Dreams,” the company is developing Dreams with Friends — a feature where users give their friends permission to generate these AI “dream” images with the two of them included, Moser discovered. References to purchasing Dream Packs found in Snapchat’s app also suggests this may be a monetizable feature at some point. Dreams was first spotted earlier this spring, when reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi revealed the feature would allow users to place their own likeness into realms powered by generative AI. The new feature was being given a prominent placement in Snapchat’s app, right in between the Camera Roll and Stories, he found. The new developments around Dreams with Friends and the Dream Packs suggest Snapchat is now moving forward with the feature. Snapchat declined to comment on its plans for Dreams."
2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/sex-tech-industry-money/,TechCrunch,VC Office Hours: Why the sex tech industry could benefit from today’s politics,"Despite the potential for technology to radically transform it, the sex tech industry isn’t actually discussed much. In most of the world, sex is still a taboo topic, and funding for the industry isn’t as robust as one might assume. Of course, sex being tabooed doesn’t help, but part of the reason for this lackluster investment seems to be that many investors have vice clauses that dictate where they can invest their limited partners’ money, and it turns out that sex is quite high on that list. Still, PitchBook shows that though the industry receives small amounts of capital, funding has remained relatively steady over the years. In 2020, sex tech startups raised $352 million, and in 2021, like most other sectors, investments in the space increased to $422 million. That fell to $275.8 million last year, in line with the general slowdown in venture capital investing. Things seem to be improving, though: Sex tech startups have raised $111.9 million this year, and if the trend keeps up, they’ll be on track to at least raise as much as they did in 2022, if not more. Some investors are not afraid. Although there is no fund focused on the space yet, some investors have it as part of their wider focus on women’s health. Jessica Karr, the co-founder of Coyote Ventures, invests across the spectrum of women’s health and wellness. Previously, she helped develop and launch the Impossible Burger and currently serves as a limited partner in other women-led funds. With Coyote, she has invested in cancer-detection company Gabbi, the fintech company The Beans, and bereavement care company Betterleave. Curious about the burgeoning sex tech market, I caught up with Karr to talk about its role in the women’s health industry, the potential of the category, and where she sees it going in the future. "
2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/developers-are-now-using-ai-for-text-to-music-apps/,TechCrunch,Developers are now using AI for text-to-music apps,"With the rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI tools like ChatGPT, developers have found use cases to mold text in different ways for use cases ranging from writing emails to summarizing articles. Now, they are looking to help you generate bits of music by just typing some words. Brett Bauman, the developer of PlayListAI (previously LinupSupply), launched a new app called Songburst on the App Store this week. The app doesn’t have a steep learning curve. You just have to type in a prompt like “Calming piano music to listen to while studying” or “Funky beats for a podcast intro” to let the app generate a music clip. If you can’t think of a prompt the app has prompts in different categories, including video, lo-fi, podcast, gaming, meditation and sample. Image Credits: Songburst Bauman told TechCrunch that he built the back end of the app using Vercel and music is generated through Leap. Currently, there is a limitation of generating 30 seconds and some output might not be of great quality. Bauman said that over time he will look to increase the length of the generated music clip and improve quality. Songburst is free to try but it offers a subscription at $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year. The subscription gives you 20 song credits per month and the ability to download tracks in the mp3 format. Users can also buy additional credits in packs of five ($7.99), 10 ($11.99) or 20 ($15.99). Bauman said he built the app because there are few simple and mobile native text-to-music solutions around which there are not spammy tactics used to draw subscription money. He’s not alone in trying to make a neat text-to-music app, however. Akhil Tolani, who has made apps like the music collaboration app Rapchat, has launched CassetteAI, which is available on the web and App Store both. At the input level, CassetteAI works similarly to other apps. You type in a prompt for music and it churns out a track. However, it can generate a sample up to three minutes long. The app maker said this is because the app works on a custom model based on seq2seq hierarchal architecture and it is trained on a specialized dataset to generate copyright-free music. Image Credits: Cassette AI The tool also provides an interface for users to create different versions of the generated tracks and edit and mix them to make a new track. These tools are pretty basic, so don’t expect to create a multilayered master track out of this just yet. Cassette AI interface for mixing tracks. Image Credits: Cassette AI Tolani said that the tool was operating on a waitlist basis, but he is opening it up to more people now. He told TechCrunch that he is also expecting a Cassette AI pro subscription priced at $4.99 per month, which will give users access to unlimited song generation and access to better-quality AI models for improved song generation. The developer mentioned that Cassette AI is better than other music generators such as Mubert and Beatbot because it generates better-quality music with a quicker turnaround time. He added that with Cassette AI, he wants to respect the ethical boundaries of the music industry. “We want people to see AI as a tool for music creation, not a replacement for creators: Calculators did not replace mathematicians, they just made it easier to calculate things. We want to make music production accessible to everyone for any use case,” he said. These tools are mainly targeting creators, who can use copyright-free music in their videos or podcasts. The developers are also hoping that musicians notice their tools and blend them into their sample or song-making process. Apart from indie developers, major tech companies are also taking a crack at the text-to-music generation problem. Google made its MusicLM tool public during the Google I/O developer conference in May. In June, Meta open sourced its own AI-powered music generator called MusicGen. While models are improving when it comes to the quality of the generated tracks, there are concerns regarding the training data they use to create music. To avoid legal troubles, OpenAI has made its Jukebox model part open sourced and has banned users from creating music for commercial use cases. Then there are some AI-forward musicians like Grimes, who in April invited fans to make songs with her voice and split royalties with her."

Soon it will be Disrupt season, and then we’ll head straight into the fourth quarter. For tech companies, that means the window to file for an IPO this year is beginning to close. Happily, some companies are expected to actually go public before 2023 ends. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Instacart, the heavily venture-backed grocery delivery and software company, is expected by some to file for its IPO as early as this week, aiming for an early-September debut. Databricks remains an IPO candidate, though it is unlikely to go “first” among former startups looking to list. The ARM transaction is also coming, putting another big-name company on the list.  The flurry of news — and, likely, progress in IPO prep and planning at some of tech’s biggest private names — comes in the middle of a slightly bad time for tech shares. Still, tech stocks have regained around half of their losses since the last tech boom faded. A week of selling can’t dent real progress by tech companies on the public markets, even if this market could trim revenue multiples for upcoming IPOs. To get here, we needed a lot of time, the SPAC bubble had to fade, revenue multiples had to reinflate, and two companies with good IPO pricing and early trading runs had to generate a lot of publicity with their own listings. If you’re hoping that your employer will finally get out the door in the next few quarters, then swing by a Cava location wearing Oddity cosmetics, because those two companies did you and your illiquid holdings a real solid by listing well earlier this year. Technology and finance media have recently had a lot to say on the IPO matter. The Information broke news regarding Instacart’s and Databricks’ growth rates, helping frame their impending listings with real numbers. The Financial Times has news about each of the core IPO candidates we’ve discussed ad nauseam. Bloomberg has notes as well. And Yahoo Finance reported that as the tech IPO market gets off its backside, it could have a massively busy 2024. "
2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/customer-engagement-platform-beamer-raises-20m/,TechCrunch,Customer engagement platform Beamer raises $20M,"Beamer, a no-code platform to build tools for measuring and monitoring product engagement, last week announced that it received a $20 million investment from Camber Partners, Beamer’s first outside round of funding. Newly appointed CEO Satya Ganni says that the proceeds will be put toward building additional product lines targeted at product managers and marketers and driving the growth of Beamer’s existing solutions. That’ll include AI-related developments and use cases, but Ganni declined to provide more info. “With customers like Atlassian, Freshworks, Hotjar, MongoDB, Unbounce, CloudKitchens, Linktree and Zenefits, Beamer’s mission is to help companies all across the globe build better products,” he told TechCrunch via email. “Beamer serves thousands of brands across the U.S., EU and Asia.” Founded in 2017 by Mariano Rodriguez and Spencer Coon, Beamer aims to help teams building apps, services and software to highlight new capabilities, prioritize what to build next and collect feedback from users. Beamer provides a changelog and notification center where developers can announce product updates and publish a roadmap that visualizes upcoming features. Using Beamer, customers can capture comments and reactions from users and try to measure a user’s loyalty over time. Beamer’s business has benefited from an industry-wide shift in focus to customer retention, says Camber Partners founder and managing partner Scott Irwin. To his point, a recent survey from OneSignal, a customer engagement platform, found that 95% of product and marketing experts believe retention is either “very important” or “somewhat important” to their businesses. The reason? It’s nearly a surefire way to boost revenue — an attractive proposition in an unsteady economy. According to research done by Frederick Reichheld of Bain & Company, increasing retention by 5% can increase profits by 25% to 95%. “We’ve observed a compelling shift in the software landscape,” Irwin said via email. “Product managers are increasingly leaning on tools to make data-driven decisions and our investment in Beamer is grounded in this observation. Their platform’s potential, particularly in user segmentation, aligns perfectly with our vision for a more integrated product management toolkit.” Beamer competes with a number of product engagement platforms on the market, including Batch, which raised $23 million in 2021. Mordor Intelligence anticipates that the sector for customer engagement solutions will be worth $33.11 billion in 2028, up from $19.73 billion in 2023. Ganni, though, expressed confidence in Beamer’s ability to remain competitive. “Our core mission at Beamer has been to help companies across the globe build better products,” he said. “With Camber’s investment and partnership, we see a strong opportunity to expand our offering and further enhance the value of our platform.” Certainly, Camber’s investment is bucking the macroeconomic trend — a strong show of confidence in Beamer’s future. Venture capital investment in Q2 2023 dropped to $29.4 billion, down from $44.4 billion in Q1 2023 — a decline of 34%. San Francisco-based Beamer has a team of 13 people. Seeking to be conservative in its operating expenses, the startup doesn’t have plans to hire within the next year."
2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/the-human-costs-of-the-ai-boom/,TechCrunch,The human costs of the AI boom,"If you use apps from world-leading technology companies such as OpenAI, Amazon, Microsoft or Google, there is a big chance you have already consumed services produced by online remote work — also known as cloudwork. Big and small organizations across the economy increasingly rely on outsourced labor available to them via platforms like Scale AI, Freelancer.com, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Fiverr and Upwork. Recently, these platforms have become crucial for artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train their AI systems and ensure they operate correctly. OpenAI is a client of Scale AI and Remotasks, labeling data for their apps ChatGPT and DALL-E. Social networks hire platforms for content moderation. Beyond the tech world, universities, businesses and NGOs (nongovernmental organizations) regularly use these platforms to hire translators, graphic designers or IT experts. Cloudwork platforms have become an essential earning opportunity for a rising number of people. A breakout study by the University of Oxford scholars Otto Kässi, Vili Lehdonvirta and Fabian Stephany estimated that more than 163 million people have registered on those websites. Freelancer.com alone has more than 67 million workers registered, the equivalent of the population of the United Kingdom. These workers, many of whom are based in low- and middle-income countries, work for clients who can be in the other corner of the world.

			AI companies are using online labor to outsource the large amounts of hidden manual work needed to build their applications.

 From the client perspective, the offer is hard to resist. Online labor platforms present them with a cheap, often skilled, workforce available 24/7. And the fierce competition for jobs on the platforms ensures the hiring company will have the upper hand in negotiating the conditions and pay. It is not surprising that AI companies are jumping on this opportunity to outsource the large amounts of hidden manual work needed to build their applications. But for the workers on the other side, the situation can be dire. They can spend large parts of their day searching and applying for jobs, time that is unpaid. For most platforms, there is no guarantee that the tasks offered will not fall below their minimum wage. And if they have any problems with the client, there is not always a clear appeal process, putting them at risk of not getting paid at all. For the third year, the Fairwork project, also based at the University of Oxford, evaluated 15 of these cloudwork platforms, such as Freelancer.com, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Fiverr and Upwork. Companies were scored on a scale of 0 to 10, according to the five principles of fair work — pay, conditions, contracts, management, and representation. The scoring criteria included, among other things, whether the platform paid workers on time, whether it mitigated health and safety risks, and whether there were clear communication channels and due process for decisions affecting workers. The results were based on a survey of 752 workers from 94 countries, as well as information gathered from platform managers. None of the platforms met more than half of these basic standards of decent work. Popular freelance platforms like Fiverr and Freelancer.com scored 2 and 1 points, respectively. Platforms focused on small tasks, like data labeling or content moderation, had among the worst scores: Appen (3), Clickworker (1), Scale/Remotasks (1), Microworkers (0), and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (0). On average, workers surveyed were earning a dismal $2.15 USD for their working time on these platforms. The results point to how many of these platforms are falling short of meeting basic workers’ rights and protections. Because of the international nature of this industry, cloudwork platforms can often circumvent national labor regulations, creating a sort of virtual Wild West where workers stand to lose. Concerningly, this model is spreading fast — supercharged by demand from AI companies and the larger trend toward remote and flexible work following the pandemic. Notably, some platforms in the study agreed to make some improvements, such as Terawork and Comeup, which implemented a minimum wage floor. However, the larger challenges in the industry can only be solved through regulations that ensure these companies are meeting the same labor standards as everyone else. At the international level, the International Labour Organization is discussing the development of standards to ensure workers’ rights in the digital economy. This is a golden opportunity to address the problems faced by workers in cloudwork platforms. However, this will not be effective if national governments around the world do not get involved too. Unfortunately, so far, discussions around regulating the platform economy have focused primarily on sectors like food delivery and ride-hailing. It is urgent that policymakers and regulators consider also the unique challenges faced by online remote workers, and put the same energy in finding solutions for this hidden, but very real, workforce."

Alongside the app launch, the company also announced new content providers, such as Variety, Rolling Stone, The Hollywood Reporter, Billboard, GameSpot, Looper and Funny or Die, among others. Amazon will continue adding more FAST channels over time, the company wrote in the press release. First introduced in May, Fire TV Channels are available on Fire TV-branded smart TVs and streaming devices. The new app offers a single destination for users to quickly access thousands of live and on-demand titles across sports, news, entertainment, cooking, gaming and more. Customers can find the Fire TV Channels app via the “Your Apps and Channels” section, the Free icon in the navigation bar or labeled content rows throughout the Fire TV user interface.

2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/apple-podcasts-gain-new-creator-tools-including-subscription-analytics-and-linkfire-integration/,TechCrunch,"Apple Podcasts gain new creator tools, including Subscription Analytics and Linkfire integration","Apple announced today several new updates to its podcast creator tools, including, most notably, the addition of Subscription Analytics within Apple Podcasts Connect — the dashboard where podcasters track how their listeners engage with their shows. In addition, Apple says it’s expanding its Delegated Delivery offering, which allows creators to publish their subscriber episodes from other hosting providers. And it’s integrating its podcast analytics into the marketing platform Linkfire for easy access. Podcast subscriptions were first launched on Apple Podcasts two years ago, and now there are thousands of shows offering subscriptions, says Apple, ranging from those produced by larger media organizations to those from independent creators. Given the pace of adoption, Apple realized creators needed better tools to understand their paying audience. Image Credits: Apple With the addition of Subscription Analytics, podcasters will gain access to a new dashboard where they can track their key metrics around subscriptions and how that part of their business is growing. This includes tracking things like which listeners started a free trial and which have become paid subscribers. However, all this data is anonymized as podcasters will only see numbers, not an individual’s personal info. Creators will be able to track, over periods of time, how many trials were started and converted, and their conversion rates to paid subscriptions. They’ll be able to see a breakdown of their monthly and annual subscriptions, if both options are provided, and they can track the performance of their trial offers. Apple notes a third of subscribers now opt for an annual plan after their introduction last year. As creators navigate all this data, they can filter modules to display real-time analytics for various time periods — like the past 30 days or the past month, for example. There’s also a heat map that will show creators which countries subscribers come from, as well as a trends view to drill into metrics around active subscribers, the conversion rate, the number of subscriptions sold over time, sales and proceeds. On the Trends tab, podcasters can also filter by Active Subscriptions to view a visual breakdown of subscribers by Subscription Status — like who are in their first year versus those who have been subscribed for more than one year. They also can view Subscription Events, like Activations, Cancellations and Renewals, and filter Sales by Subscription Duration to see the breakdown of estimated proceeds generated by monthly versus yearly subscriptions. The new service is today becoming available at no cost to podcast creators with at least one active subscription and an Admin, Finance or Legal role in Apple Podcasts Connect. In addition, these tools and others will become accessible through Linkfire, a marketing platform currently used by artists and labels, which has now expanded into podcasts. Image Credits: Apple/Linkfire Linkfire will be the first to offer integrated access to Apple Podcasts’ analytics and insights from its own dashboard. Here, creators can measure engagement with Linkfire’s smart links and landing pages, including anonymized visits, click-throughs and click-through rates. Creators can also customize their Linkfire landing page to connect listeners with their Apple Podcasts shows, in addition to including links to other platforms, like other apps, social media, newsletters, merch stores, live events and more. Image Credits: Apple/Linkfire Like Apple, Linkfire respects user privacy by only offering aggregated and anonymized insights, while still making it possible to attribute performance to a specific channel, campaign or promotion, thanks to its use of smart links and landing pages. This lets podcasters track how well their promotions perform, including audio cross promotions, digital ads and subscription offers, among other things. Plus, creators can track whether a listener played an episode, followed a show, or subscribed via Apple Podcasts. Image Credits: Apple/Linkfire In addition, podcast creators who offer an Apple Podcasts Subscription and participate in the Apple Podcasts Affiliate Program can add their affiliate token to Linkfire’s links to measure the free trials, subscriptions, subscription revenue, and affiliate commissions generated using these links. Linkfire for Podcasts is launching today but only in a limited beta with select creators and shows for the time being. It will become available globally this fall. Additional features, like the ability to customize link branding and invite collaborators, can be unlocked with a $9.99 per month subscription. Image Credits: Apple/Linkfire Alongside the new Subscription Analytics and Linkfire partnership, Apple also announced an expansion of Delegated Delivery, first introduced in January. This lets creators publish subscriber episodes directly from their hosting provider’s own dashboard. Today, Delegated Delivery is offered by Blubrry, Libsyn, Triton Digital’s Omny Studio and RSS.com. Omny says that 50% of new subscription episodes are published to Apple Podcasts using Delegated Delivery, including those from BBC Studios. Image Credits: Apple By year-end, Apple says more hosting provided will support Delegated Delivery including Audiomeans, Captivate, Podbean, Podspace and Transistor. Podbean will begin its support today, however. Apple isn’t the only platform offering podcast subscriptions. Spotify introduced the option in early 2021, expanding globally by year-end. Patreon is also a popular platform for podcast subscriptions, allowing creators to earn an income from their shows outside of advertising alone."
2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/usage-based-pricing-is-a-natural-fit-for-saas-and-generative-ai/,TechCrunch,How any SaaS company can monetize generative AI,"If you work in SaaS, you’ve likely already been part of a conversation at your company about how your customers can benefit with increased value from your products infused with generative AI, large language models (LLMs) or custom AI/ML models. As you hash out your approach and draw up the product roadmap, I wanted to call out an important aspect — one that I couldn’t help but draw an analogy to the good ol’ California Gold Rush. Don’t show up to the gold rush without a shovel! Similarly, don’t overlook the monetization aspect of your SaaS + AI. Factor it in at the outset and integrate the right plumbing at the start — not as an afterthought or post-launch. Last year, I wrote about the inevitable shift to metered pricing for SaaS. The catalyst that would propel the shift was unknown at the time, but the foundational thesis was intact. No one could have predicted back then that a particular form of AI would serve to be that catalyst. First thing to realize is that what is required is not merely a “pricing” change. It is a business model change. Traditionally, SaaS pricing has been a relatively lightweight exercise with a simple per seat model and a price point set sufficiently high above underlying costs to attain desired margins.

			Don’t show up to the gold rush without a shovel!

 A pricing change would be a change in what you charge; for example, going from $79 per user/month to $99 per user/month. A monetization model change is a fundamental shift in how you charge, and with AI as a consumption vector, it inevitably requires a need for accurate metering and usage-based pricing models. There’s already a handful of great examples of companies leveraging usage-based pricing to monetize AI, including OpenAI and all companies that provide foundational AI models and services, and the likes of Twilio, Snap, Quizlet, Instacart, and Shopify that are integrating with these services to offer customer-facing tooling. One challenge of monetizing generative AI is that the prompts and outputs vary in length, and the prompt/output size and resource consumption are directly related — with a larger prompt requiring greater resources to process and vice versa. Adding to the complexity, one customer may use the tool sparingly while another could be generating new text multiple times daily for weeks on end, resulting in a much larger cost footprint. Any viable pricing model must account for this variability and scale accordingly. On top of this, services like ChatGPT are themselves priced according to a usage-based model. This means that any tools leveraging ChatGPT or other models will be billed based on the usage; since the back-end costs of providing service are inherently variable, the customer-facing billing should be usage-based as well. To deliver the most fair and transparent pricing, and enable frictionless adoption and user growth, companies should look to usage-based pricing. Having both elastic front-end usage and back-end costs position generative AI products as ideal fits with usage-based pricing. Here’s how to get started. Companies leverage prebuilt or trained models from a plethora of companies and may further train them with their custom dataset and then incorporate them into their technology stack as features. To obtain complete visibility into usage costs and margins, each usage call (be it API or direct) to AI infrastructure should be metered to understand the usage (underlying cost footprint). "
2023-08-21,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/pinterest-rolls-out-new-teen-safety-features-including-wiping-followers-from-users-15-and-under/,TechCrunch,"Pinterest rolls out new teen safety features, including wiping followers from users 15 and under","Pinterest today introduced a series of new safety features aimed at better protecting teens using its service. The features — which include things like private profiles, more control over followers and message safety controls — are similar to those introduced on other popular social media platforms with teens, like Instagram. On Pinterest, users ages 16 and older will now be able to opt into either a private or public profile. If they choose to go private, they can still network with friends by sending a unique link that allows them to connect. These private profiles — which remain the default for users under the age of 16 — are not discoverable by others on the platform. This mirrors the decision made at Instagram, which also defaults users to private if under 16 but then allows teens to opt to turn their profiles public if they choose. In addition, all users, including teens under 16, will have more control over their followers and will be able to review and remove followers they don’t want tracking their posts. For teens under 16, followers will be removed, forcing them to start fresh and specifically choose who they want to collaborate with and who they trust. That’s likely going to generate some backlash from teens who have been growing their following and will have to start over re-adding all their friends. However, these changes come as a necessity given the reporting from earlier this year by NBC News, which exposed how pedophiles had been using Pinterest’s service to curate image boards of young girls. Many of the users under 16 had lied about their ages, which is why their profiles were discoverable. As a result, Pinterest announced a new set of parental controls and updated age verification policies, among other things to better protect its younger users. At the time, it said it would update other features so teens would be able to safely connect with people they know and trust in the future. Image Credits: Pinterest Another of today’s changes follows up on that promise as it makes messaging and group boards available to all users, but only if you give them permission to contact you or collaborate. Teens under 16 will only be able to receive messages from their mutual followers who were accepted through a shared profile link. This link expires after three days or after the sender receives their first five followers with the shareable link, whichever comes first. Meanwhile, for parents and guardians, Pinterest already offers a feature that requires a passcode they set before a teen can change their account settings. Now caregivers will have the ability to opt in and out of this passcode feature and can update the protected settings on their teen’s account. Image Credits: Pinterest Pinterest says all the new features and changes will begin rolling out this week, which means you may not immediately see them today. The company has needed to address teen safety for some time, given its heavy use among younger users. In its most recent earnings call with investors, the company touted its young demographic. “We’ve noted this multiple times that Gen Z is our fastest-growing demographic and our largest contributor to overall engagement, which means it’s not just a high growth rate on a small denominator. It’s our largest contributor to overall engagement growth,” said Pinterest CEO Bill Ready. “To be able to say that we have Gen Z, a more recent cohort that’s actually engaging even more deeply than our prior cohorts, I think is quite exceptional.” Ready noted how young people’s use of the site helped Pinterest pursue its goals of being the first stop to plan for things like travel and shopping. The company has also targeted Gen Z with its shoppable scrapbooking app Shuffles, which went viral last year. "

Besides voicing the world’s most famous plumber, the 67-year-old Martinet also portrayed Luigi, Wario, Waluigi and the baby versions of these characters in more than 100 titles across the Mario video game franchise. “Charles Martinet has been the original voice of Mario in Nintendo games for a long time, as far back as Super Mario 64,” Nintendo wrote. “He will be stepping back from recording character voices for our games, but he’ll continue to travel the world sharing the joy of Mario.” Nintendo says that Martinet will stay connected with the Mario universe, taking on a brand new role as “Mario Ambassador.” It’s not super clear what that means, but that’s one hell of a job title. For the most dedicated Mario fans, Martinet’s departure didn’t come out of left field. In the recent Super Mario Bros. Movie, Martinet relinquished his Mario duties to Chris Pratt, which struck some fans as a weird choice — he did make a cameo as Mario’s father, though. According to Polygon, fans also noticed that Martinet’s iconic voice was missing from trailers from two upcoming Nintendo Switch games, Super Mario Bros. Wonder and WarioWare: Move It. Now, these super Super Mario fans have closure. “It has been an honor working with Charles to help bring Mario to life for so many years,” Nintendo wrote. The company will soon post a video message from Martinet and Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo executive and Mario creator, as a final send off."
2023-08-20,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/20/jio-financial-services-reliances-20-billion-spin-off-makes-market-debut/,TechCrunch,Reliance spin-off Jio Financial Services slides on market debut,"For years, the Indian market has been anticipating a public debut of Reliance Retail and Jio Platforms. But in a surprise move late last year, Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest man and chairman of conglomerate Reliance Industries, put together a different offering — a little-known non-bank financial subsidiary — for the market. That demerged offering, Jio Financial Services, made its public debut on Monday, listing at 262 Indian rupees ($3.15) per share, the price set last month in a special session by local exchanges. But on Monday, the market didn’t buy that price. Within minutes of trading, the share fell at 248.9 Indian rupees and hit the lower circuit on the local exchanges (prompting the exchanges to halt trading), pushing Jio Financial Services’ market cap to $19.2 billion. At that valuation, the unit is already one of the largest financial services companies in India even as it’s off to a weak start. Jio Financial, which owns 6.1% stake in Reliance, may see a sell-off of $465 million by passive investors, Nuvama estimates. Reliance has not said a lot about what Jio Financial Services will do — other than announcing last month a partnership with BlackRock to launch an asset management platform for consumers in India. In filings, Reliance has suggested that its services may include consumer and merchant lending, payments platform, insurance broking, AMC and other NLFs, analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note on Sunday. In a note Monday, Morgan Stanley analysts described Jio Financial Services as a financial holding company with operating businesses in its subsidiaries.

It will build payments platforms focussed around merchants, ramp-up Jio Payments Bank and build insurance broking,” Jefferies analysts wrote."
2023-08-20,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/20/mycoprotein-enough-40m-foodtech/,TechCrunch,Mycoprotein producer Enough raises €40M toward doubling its production capacity,"Making protein out of mushrooms is not a new concept; however, Enough believes its technology — and the ability to scale production quickly — will set it apart. The Scotland-based company grabbed €40 million ($43.5 million in today’s dollars) in new growth funding to test out that theory. Enough is pumping that dough into doubling the output capacity of its first production site in the Netherlands, completed last September. Enough was founded as 3F BIO in 2015 by Jim Laird, who has a background in food operations. The company’s proprietary technology feeds fungi with sugars from renewable feedstocks and then ferments it similar to the way beer is made. What results is the Abunda sustainable mycoprotein, which the company says has a neutral flavor and meaty texture and is high in protein and fiber. That protein can then be used to make plant-based meat, fish and dairy products. The company also boasts that Abunda is “up to 15 times more efficient than protein from beef,” also using less feed and producing fewer carbon dioxide emissions, which is how it’s also more affordable to produce. “What sets us apart is our focus on introducing high-scale capacity that will serve the market on a B2B basis and with the ability to grow in line with the growing market,” Laird said in an email interview. “As the protein transition continues there is a need for non animal sources that make food that tastes as good or better and costs the same or less than the animal, and our process achieves that aim.” Prior to building the Netherlands factory, Enough was producing small batches. Now with that online, the company is ramping up, initially producing over a tonne of Abunda every hour and around 10,000 metric tonnes per year. The lead time from factory trials at its customers to the point where Enough supplies to retailers will often take six months, so the company does not expect retail launches until the end of the year, and more beginning in 2024, Laird said. “We expect that demand could start to exceed our capacity by the second half of 2024, and for that reason, we are starting the installation of a second line,” Laird said. “Doubling our capacity is an important next step, but if we believe the estimates from the big banks and consultancies it is nowhere near enough to meet the growing global demand, which is forecasted to be about 10,000 tonnes per week, or the equivalent of one of our lines needed every week.” Future plans include scaling up to over 60,000 tonnes per year starting in 2024, which Laird said would be the equivalent of growing one cow’s worth of protein every two minutes. The company expects to reach over a million tonnes, cumulatively, by 2032. Should the market continue in the forecasted trajectory, Laird said Enough has plans for a second location and is eyeing North America. Today, Enough joins mushroom-focused food tech companies like Meati Foods and Fable Foods in bringing in a round of new venture capital. The growth funding, which closed this month, brings Enough’s total capital raised to date to over €95 million ($103 million). World Fund and CPT Capital co-led the round, while existing investors, including AXA IM Alts through the Axa Impact Fund, HAL Investments through 280ppm, Onassis Group through Olympic Investments Inc., Tailored Solutions and Scottish Enterprise were also part of the investment. The new investment will enable the company to scale up capacity at the factory and grow its teams across its offices in Glasgow, London and at Sas van Gent. Enough’s employee base doubled in size to 50 in 2022, and has now grown to 60, including adding John Gray as managing director of its Europe operations. Meanwhile, the company is working with some of its partners, including Plukon Food Group, M&S and Unilever, on first-market launches. It is also gearing up to build its second production line to be completed at the end of 2024. “We continue to strengthen the team in key areas and will continue to look at our growth finance needs,” Laird said. “The challenges in a growth industry is in aligning capacity with demand. Our balance over the coming years will be on installing capacity ahead of the growing demand curve.”"

ElectraMeccanica, previously the maker of the three-wheeled Solo EV, is merging with electric truck startup Tevva, and the whole deal makes me wonder if there’s a place for such tiny autocycles in the U.S. The Solo could have been a neat way to get around cities, for both commuters and delivery drivers. But ElectraMeccanica struggled to produce its vehicles in a way that was cost-effective. The company faced adoption issues as three-wheelers were excluded from government rebates and it was too difficult to insure the vehicles. Back in March, ElectraMeccanica dropped the three-wheeled pursuit in favor of a more mainstream form of transport. I understand why ElectraMeccanica went with electric trucks. Incentives abound, and going for commercial customers is always a good idea. But it’s sad to see such a green and interesting form of transport fail to make it off the ground. Especially when Arcimoto, probably the only other maker of tiny three-wheeled EVs, is also struggling to stay afloat. Perhaps it’s only the three-wheeled aspect that makes such vehicles difficult for America to love. Electric golf carts appear to be on the rise, with some American families (particularly ones in warm climates like Florida) viewing the vehicles as a “second car.” — Rebecca Bellan  Talk about a wild ride! Vietnamese EV maker VinFast made its debut on the Nasdaq exchange with a bang. The company, which went public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Black Spade Acquisition, saw shares shoot up 68% to close at $37.06 and a valuation of $86 billion. To put that into perspective, GM, Ford and Stellantis have market caps that are in the $45 billion to $50 billion range. The celebrations didn’t last long. VinFast’s stock has plummeted in the days since. VinFast shares closed Friday at $15.40, which perhaps isn’t suprising considering the young EV upstart delivered just 11,300 vehicles in the first half of 2023 — not to mention its fundamentals show a company with costly ambitions that far outweigh revenue. Other deals that got my attention … Assembly Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm that invests in mobility technologies, closed its inaugural $76 million Assembly Ventures Fund I. Some investors in the fund include strategic corporates such as Arbor Bancorp Inc. and Stellantis Ventures. A number of automotive, AV tech and VC veterans also invested in the fund, including Wolfgang Bernhart, Matt Cullen, Calvin Ford, Dan Gilbert (DVP), Philipp von Hagen, Joe Hinrichs, Karl Iagnemma, Jody Kelman, Tim Lalonde, Kathleen Ligocki, John Moavenzadeh, Stephen Polk, Tony Posawatz and Dug Song. General Motors led a $60 million Series B round into battery materials startup Mitra Chem. Helm.ai, a startup that developed software for autonomous driving and automation of robotics, raised $55 million in its Series C round led by Freeman Group. Venture capital firms ACVC Partners and Amplo, as well as strategic investors Honda Motor, Goodyear Ventures and Sungwoo Hitech, also participated. Helm.ai has now raised $102 million to date. JetZero, a commercial aerospace startup, was awarded a $235 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to build a jet with a blended wing body.

When the California Public Utilities Commission voted to approve final permits allowing Cruise and Waymo to expand robotaxi operations and charge for driverless rides, I made a comment that not all newsletter readers appreciated. I wrote: “Cruise and Waymo may have won this battle, but the war to win over the public is hardly over.” The past week has proven my point. Cruise experienced several embarrassing snafus in the few days following the vote, including videos showing vehicles blocking traffic and one driving into wet cement. It was enough to prompt the San Francisco City Attorney’s office to file motions with the CPUC to rollback that approval. And that was before Thursday night, when Cruise collided with a fire truck that was responding to an emergency. A day after that crash, the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles in the state, asked Cruise to immediately reduce its robotaxi fleet in San Francisco by 50% while it investigates the incident. Cruise has complied with the request. A 75MW solar farm backed by Electrify America is up and running.

2023-08-20,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/20/theres-no-single-winner-in-any-market/,TechCrunch,VCs should give up on the winner-takes-all approach to investing,"Venture capital is the business of hitting home runs. But must a startup have the potential to capture the vast majority of market share in its category to earn an investment? I don’t think so. A few days ago, the co-founder and CEO of Thumbtack, Marco Zappacosta, came on TechCrunch’s Found podcast to talk about building his home services startup. I asked him what was next for Thumbtack, considering the startup is 15 years old and was last valued at $3.1 billion. I thought he might talk about a potential exit, but his answer surprised me.  “For our industry, [the adoption of booking home services online on a platform like Thumbtack] is less than 10%. We are still in the very early days of this sort of transition in evolution. I think people don’t appreciate how big this category can and will be,” Zappacosta said. “It also speaks to what we’re still trying to do, because we think we’re still early in this whole sector.” Thumbtack shares that 10% figure with a handful of other players in the space, including TaskRabbit, Angie’s List and other startups like Jiffy. In home services, a company only needs to grab a few percentage points of the overall market share to be a multi-billion-dollar business. If you think about it, most established categories look more like a handful of winners than just one. In the travel sector, there is Booking.com, Trivago and Kayak. Even established categories like credit cards see both Visa and Mastercard dominating the market. Even markets with a seemingly dominant player can support multiple winners. In music streaming, Spotify seems like the clear victor in its category, but it has only 31% of the global streaming market — that’s significant, but there’s still a good amount of market share left for its competitors like Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer, Pandora, and SoundCloud. And while some markets like treatments for rare blood diseases may not be large enough to support numerous successful players, most do.  "
2023-08-20,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/20/ip-for-startups-patents/,TechCrunch,IP for startups: When (not) to patent your inventions,"When it comes to intellectual property, “patents” might spring to mind. A good patent can give startups a competitive edge, and once you’ve been granted one, nobody can come and mess with your technology, right? Not so fast. A lot is changing in the patents world, and things can quickly start to get complicated. We spoke with Michele Moreland, general partner at Aventurine, a venture fund that is taking an IP-first approach to investing. Moreland has been at the cutting edge of IP strategy throughout her career and has been responsible for $3 billion in patent verdicts as a portfolio strategist. As a trial lawyer, Moreland represented some of the most important tech companies of our time, including Qualcomm, Amgen and Nvidia. In this article, we’ll explore what to look for when hiring patent counsel, how much it typically costs to file a patent, the difference between provisional and full patents, how patents can be an important part of your IP strategy, and why trade secrets may be a better bet in some cases. The America Invents Act (AIA) was passed in 2011, dramatically changing how patents work in the U.S. Until 2011, the U.S. was a “first to invent” system, meaning that if you were the first person to come up with an invention, the patent was yours. The new system is more aligned with patent systems across much of the rest of the world and is a first-to-file system. We went from a race to build to a race to the patent office. Of course, writing up a full patent application is nontrivial, and that’s where provisional patents come in. A provisional patent application (PPA) is a legal document filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office that establishes a filing date. This patent does not automatically become an issued patent: Applicants have a year to apply for the full patent (sometimes known as a utility patent). A provisional application allows inventors to secure a “patent pending” status for their invention without engaging in the full, formal patenting process. "
2023-08-20,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/20/a-tale-of-two-payments-companies/,TechCrunch,A tale of two payments companies,"Welcome back to The Interchange, where we take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. There was plenty going on as usual — with fintech investors sounding off, payments companies seeing big stock moves and much more. One other note, you can find Mary Ann on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, which she co-hosts every Friday with Alex Wilhelm, including this episode that came out Friday. If you want to receive The Interchange directly in your inbox every Sunday, head here to sign up! This past week, we saw two global payments companies release earnings with wildly different results. Uruguayan fintech company dLocal saw its stock surge by over 30% on Wednesday alone on the news that the payments outfit had tapped former Mercado Libre CFO Pedro Arnt as its new co-CEO. Shares closed that day up nearly 32% at $20.45, after climbing as high as $24.22 earlier in the day, giving the company a $6 billion valuation. That surge was on top of an August 15 spike after the company beat earnings estimates in releasing its second-quarter financials. Impressively, dLocal reported revenue of $161 million, up 59% year-over-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter. The company also saw a large jump in profits, reporting gross profit of $70.8 million in the second quarter of 2023, up 43% year-over-year compared to $49.6 million in the second quarter of 2022 and up 14% compared to $61.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Earlier this summer, I caught up with dLocal co-founder Sergio Fogel, who rejoined the company in June as co-president and chief strategy officer, per a Bloomberg report, “as part of a push to help regain investor confidence and stabilize the company’s stock after it tumbled following a probe in Argentina and a short seller attack.” You can read the details of that interview here. By Friday afternoon, shares were trading at just under $20 and the company’s market cap hovered at $5.8 billion. Meanwhile, shares of Dutch payments processor Adyen sank “to their lowest level in more than three years” on Friday, as reported by Reuters and others. Shares were trading at $872 as of Friday afternoon, down significantly from a 52-week high of $1,763.80. That was after a 39% drop on Thursday, according to CNBC, after the company “reported worse-than-expected sales and a profit drop in the first half of the year.” Specifically, Adyen notched revenue of $804.3 million in the first half of 2023, up 21% from a year ago but below analyst estimates. According to CNBC, “Adyen attributed the tepid print to increased hiring, firmer wages and to a shift in its North American customers’ business prioritization from growth to cost savings in the first half of the year.” Revenue growth is slowing. In the first half of 2022, revenues climbed by 37% year-over-year. Despite the not-so-great news, Adyen remains one of Europe’s highly valued fintechs, with a market cap of $27.22 billion euros. Notably, while Adyen has made a heavy push in North America, dLocal has done the opposite — saying that market is already well-served and instead focusing its efforts on emerging markets such as Latin America and Africa. Mary Ann conducted a survey of six fintech investors, including Index Ventures’ Mark Goldberg, Upfront Ventures’ Aditi Maliwal, GGV Capital’s Hans Tung, TTV Capital’s Lizzie Guynn, Norwest Venture Partners’ Ed Yip and Acrew Capital’s Lauren Kolodny. One of the more interesting findings is that not everyone is going all in on artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, Tung shared that while he is “most excited” about AI, he also believes the sector is the most overhyped, telling TechCrunch: “It is central to the core business in some companies, and in others, it is simply a supporting character.” There are too many other interesting nuggets to share, so check out the full survey results here. As reported by Jacquelyn Melinek: “Credit cards payments processor Checkout.com is no longer servicing Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, a spokesperson from the exchange told TechCrunch. ‘There is no impact on our services and users can continue to use on-and off-ramps as usual,’ the Binance spokesperson added. London-based Checkout.com, which was valued at $40 billion in January 2022, terminated the relationship earlier this month through a pair of letters, according to a report from Forbes.” More here. Reporter Sarah Perez covered PayPal’s announcement about its new CEO Alex Chriss, who will take the helm of the company in late September. Prior to joining PayPal, Chriss was a long-time employee at Intuit, working his way up to lead Intuit’s Small Business and Self-Employed Group. He replaces current PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, who will remain as part of the company’s board of directors until its next shareholders meeting in 2024. Meet Alex Chriss. As reported by Tage Kene-Okafor, Mastercard is plunking down some dough to take a minority stake in the fintech division of MTN Group, Africa’s largest cell phone provider, which it values at $5.2 billion. Both companies are close to signing on the dotted line, and the deal reportedly came about a year after MTN Group began seeking out some investors for the fintech division after it was separated from the company’s main telecom business. Read more. The Information reported that spend management startup Ramp is raising “several hundred million dollars” at a $5.5 billion valuation in a round led by Thrive Capital. The company last raised in March 2022 — $200 million in equity funding at an $8.1 billion valuation. We expect to have more to share on that front next week. Meanwhile, other spend management players announced new features this week. Brex revealed it has expanded into group events, an unexpected move for a fintech company — but execs say the decision was based after seeing how many off-sites its customers were booking. Mesh Payments announced its own expansion into travel with a built-from-within solution. More on both of those initiatives here. Bluevine CEO: IPO filing in 18 to 24 months. The company also told TechCrunch via email that it has surpassed over 160,000 active monthly accounts, 500,000 in total customers served, $14 billion in loans delivered and $850 million in checking account deposits. It also said it’s tracking $200 million in 2023 revenue, reflecting 80% year-over-year growth. Bluevine also claims it’s “outpacing the SBA on lending to minority business owners (by ~600% over past 3 years), and indexing 39% higher on minority biz owner bank accounts relative to the % of minorities making up the US adult population.” Fintech startup Mercury said last week that it is launching a SAFE offering. Via email, the company told TechCrunch: “With VC funding contracting and priced rounds becoming increasingly hard to secure, SAFE agreements are vital tools for bridge round funding. With this new offering, Mercury customers can create, sign, and distribute SAFE investment documents as well as request and track payments for their investment rounds, all through Mercury, for free.” In July, TechCrunch reported on how Mercury has seen a surge in customers in the months after SVB’s implosion.

2023-08-20,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/20/speed-and-tech-dominated-the-lawns-at-monterey-car-week/,TechCrunch,Speed and tech dominated the lawns at Monterey Car Week,"The Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance is just the cherry on top of a week of events highlighting, celebrating and sometimes even worshiping the automobile. While the lawn on Sunday mostly focuses on the past, other events like The Quail and the numerous private debuts scattered around Monterey, California have their sights very much set on the future of high-end motoring. If there was a theme this year it was speed at any cost. Electrification was a huge story and indeed we saw a few EV debuts that are truly attainable in an everyday sense. However, the true head-turners were more exotic, crafted of advanced composites or sculpted in additive manufacturing labs, riding on next-generation suspensions and battling it out for lap-time supremacy on some of the world’s greatest testing grounds. Image Credits: Tim Stevens At last year’s Monterey Car Week festivities, Acura showed off a concept version of an all-electric rebirth for the ZDX. This year, Acura is back with the production model. Impressively, the final car looked little different than last year’s flight of fancy, but still it carried a bit of a surprise: It’s built on the General Motors Ultium platform. Yes, Acura is teaming up with GM to create this battery-powered crossover, which will offer an EPA-estimated range of 325 miles and, if you go with the Type S flavor, will deliver 500 horsepower to all four wheels. Pricing for the 340 hp rear-drive version is said to start around $60,000 and, as a 2024 model year machine, should be hitting the road soon. If they don’t make it available in that blue, it’ll be a crime. Image Credits: Tim Stevens Though the all-conquering Chiron is nearing the end of its production, Bugatti is continuing to celebrate the car, this year unveiling a one-off called “Golden Era.” It features a custom designed mural celebrating the history of the marque. More interesting, though, is what’s to come. Now that Bugatti has merged with Rimac, Achim Anscheidt, Bugatti’s head of design for a whopping 19 years, is taking on a more advisory role. He’ll be working directly with founder and CEO Mate Rimac to help define both the future of Rimac and Bugatti. “I have to say, the DNA of Bugatti is fairly straightforward and clear in evolution out of the last 15 to 20 years,” he told us. “The DNA Rimac still needs one more in-depth development of what that stands for.” Anscheidt said he’s working on ways for Rimac to develop a “stronger identity” for its future products, in terms of style and character. He’s also helping to define what the next-generation Bugatti will look like, a car that will feature some degree of electrification and doubtlessly epic performance. Image Credits: Tim Stevens The 3D-printed 21C supercar is finally becoming a reality and, while the first customer deliveries are still a few months away, the big fanfare this week was around a version called Blackbird Edition, honoring the iconic SR-71 Blackbird. With 1,350 horsepower, 100 more than the standard 21C, Blackbird will doubtlessly be quick, and like the regular version will ride on components crafted through generative design and additive manufacturing. Czinger is making just four, priced in the $2 million ballpark, and all have been sold. “Within one day of revealing that car, they’re gone, which is a nice feeling,” Lukas Czinger, co-founder of Czinger, told TechCrunch. But, the company’s job isn’t done. On Sunday after the Concours, Czinger will be hosting a drive for 30 lucky 21C buyers. “I get nervous every time you put customers in the car, you hope they love it, but every time we have, they have.” Image Credits: Tim Stevens Yes, America’s Blue Oval was mixing it up with the multimillion-dollar hypercars at The Quail this year, unveiling the Mustang GTD. This model, inspired by the track-only GT3, will bring outrageous performance and some novel technology, like an active aerodynamics system and suspension that can adjust both damper compression and spring rate for either road or track. The ultimate target, though, is the track. “This vehicle is going to set a sub-seven-minute ‘Ring time,” Greg Goodall, Ford’s chief program engineer told TechCrunch after the GTD’s unveiling, targeting performance on Germany’s Nürburgring, an ever-present battleground for manufacturer bragging rights. “The technology is something we’ve never done on Mustang,” he said. Image Credits: Tim Stevens Lamborghini is dipping its toes into electrification with the upcoming plug-in hybrid Revuelto hypercar, and the Urus SUV is getting electrified as well. But, at this year’s Pebble Beach, the company showed off a preview of what will be its first full-bore EV: the Lanzador. Though just a concept, Lamborghini says this is more or less what its first EV will look like when it goes into production in 2028. “A real teaser for what is going to happen,” Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann told us. When it does, this will become what Lamborghini is calling its “fourth model concept,” joining the Urus, Revuelto and whatever replaces the Aventador. Lanzador has an unusual shape, a tall coupe that looks to draw in the practicality and comfort of a crossover SUV while still delivering the driving dynamics of a sporty GT with 2+2 seating. “It’s the best of both worlds,” Winkelmann said. “We looked into every opportunity, until we found out that a higher seating position is mainly what everybody likes.” No details on anticipated performance or range, only that Lanzador will have all-wheel-drive from a pair of electric motors and will feature some aspect of active aerodynamics. Image Credits: Tim Stevens Maserati’s big debut at the show was MCXtrema (née Project24), a sort of limited-edition version of the company’s MC20. With 730 horsepower and some impressive aerodynamics, it looks a little too wild for the street. And that’s because it is. “It’s the most extreme version, thus the name extrema, of the MC20,” Bill Peffer, CEO of Maserati Americas, told TechCrunch. “This is a track-only weapon, if you will, not homologated for the street.” The car does have an FIA-certified integrated roll cage, meaning it can run at maximum speed at many of the greatest tracks in the world. Only 62 will be made and, yes, they’re all spoken for. Image Credits: Tim Stevens Last year at The Quail, visitors fell in love with the Meyers Manx 2.0 — the rebirth of an iconic motoring toy from the 1960s. This year, many of those fans were surprised to learn what the first run of the machines will cost: $74,000. But, if you look at the car’s details, with its carbon fiber body and beautifully crafted switchgear, you can see where that money is going. Thankfully, there’s a cheaper option coming. Meet the Resorter, a high-end entrant into the utilitarian Neighborhood Electric Vehicle, or NEV category, like the Eli ZERO or GEM e4. “It’s a growing niche that allows vehicles to be on public roads, but limits the speed up to 25 miles per hour,” Freeman Thomas told TechCrunch. Thomas is CEO of the reconstituted Meyers Manx and is well-known for his iconic designs like the original Audi TT and Volkswagen New Beetle. The Resorter’s limited speed simplifies its construction and, more significantly, lowers the cost: $49,000. The 2.0, though, is also set to get cheaper with time. “As we ramp up, we’re gonna look at ways to bring pricing down,” Thomas said, saying that a non-carbon-body could become an option in the future. “But, right now, to get up and running, our costs are very high.” Image Credits: Tim Stevens While Pininfarina had its own hypercars on display, showing off the new B95 roofless (and windshield-free) electric weapon, with 1,877 horsepower and a 0-60 time of 2.0 seconds. However, the company’s bigger story, quite literally, was the PURA Vision concept. Dubbed an electric luxury vehicle, or e-LUV, the thing is meant to represent a “new era of pure-electric luxury.” Large and curvaceous, looking a bit like it had been stung by a bee next to the low, sleek Battista and B95, the PURA Vision is a radical departure for the storied designer of many iconic sports cars for other manufacturers. Many of those cars are referenced in the design, though, like doors honoring the 1957 Lancia Florida concept, while the interior is inspired by super yachts. No word on whether this will come to production, but the B95 will in extremely limited numbers. Pininfarina will build 10 cars, each priced at just south of $5 million. Image Credits: Tim Stevens Rimac, the Croatian electric hypercar company that has taken the world by storm, took a curious approach by launching a car not based on what it could do, but based on what it did do. On the morning of its debut, Rimac announced that a limited edition of the Nevera, aptly dubbed “Time Attack,” had taken the electric production car record at the Nürburgring with a time of 7:05:298. That’s just one performance record of 20 that the car has set this year. CEO Mate Rimac, though, wants more. “Am I happy? No,” he told us. “It still has a seven in the front and I was hoping maybe a six. But it’s our first time, you know?” Rimac promised they’ll be back to the ‘Ring for more in the future. In the interim, it will build 12 of the Nevera Time Attack editions, each with a numbered plaque. All have already been sold. Image Credits: Tim Stevens While high-powered, mid-engined hypercars were everywhere at this year’s event, Danish Zenvo launched not one but two. The two vehicles are called Agil and Tur, the former optimized for high-downforce on-track performance, the latter for high-speed runs of up to 280 mph. They share quite a bit, including a brand new, quad-turbo V12 that can make up to 1,850 horsepower thanks in part to a hybrid system. However, according to Zenvo chairman Jens Sverdrup, this really wasn’t about the specs. “We have big numbers in the car, they’re impressive, but they’ve never been the point. The point of the car is to turn everything up as far as it can until we get trade-offs,” he told us. “We can have 3,000 horsepower… it’s possible, but it doesn’t make the car better.” What does make the car better? An obsession with analog detailing and tactility. The cockpit features a number of pods instead of a traditional gauge cluster. Everything looks analog, including the gear indicator, displayed via numbers on a disc like a date wheel on a fine watch. But, the technology is there. When needed, those pods flip over to reveal digital displays. No pricing was announced, but with only 50 of each being made, expect a price with seven digits."
2023-08-19,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/19/apple-devices-spoofed-musk-eggs-on-zuckerberg-and-better-com-goes-public/,TechCrunch,"Apple devices spoofed, Musk eggs on Zuckerberg and Better.com goes public","Welcome, friends, to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch’s regular newsletter covering the major events in tech over the past few days. Haven’t had your eyes glued to the headlines? Not to worry. That’s our job, and we’ve compiled them in the nifty little digest that is WiR. In this week’s edition of WiR, we cover a $70 device that can spoof an Apple device, hackers stealing Americans’ health data from an IBM system, and Elon Musk pledging to fight Mark Zuckerberg in a proper cage match. Elsewhere, we spotlight X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, slowing down access to rival websites; Better.com going public; and TC’s impressions of Baldur’s Gate 3. It’s a lot to get to, so buckle up. Oh, and if you haven’t already, sign up here to get WiR in your inbox every Saturday. A cheap Apple spoofer: Attendees at Def Con, one of the world’s largest hacking conferences, observed that their iPhones were showing pop-up messages prompting them to connect their Apple ID or share a password with a nearby Apple TV. Turns out it was a part of a research project — a $70 device that can spoof an Apple device and trick unsuspecting users into sharing their password. Americans’ health records stolen: Millions of Americans had their sensitive medical and health information stolen after hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the widely used MOVEit file transfer software raided systems operated by tech giant IBM. The Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which is responsible for administering Colorado’s Medicaid program, confirmed on Friday that it had fallen victim to the MOVEit mass hacks, exposing the data of more than 4 million patients. Musk versus Zuckerberg: In June, X CEO Elon Musk challenged Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, a practitioner of Brazilian jiujitsu, to a cage fight — for charity. After repeated delays on Musk’s end, last week, Musk promised that the fight was still happening. But shortly afterward, Zuckerberg said that he and Musk couldn’t agree to terms, including a venue and date, and that it was time to “move on.” X slows down access: X was found to have throttled traffic to websites that the social network’s owner, Elon Musk, publicly dislikes. The platform slowed down the speed it takes when accessing links to a handful of websites, including The New York Times, Instagram, Facebook, Bluesky, Threads, Reuters and Substack. Better.com goes public: Digital mortgage lender Better.com’s proposal to combine with Aurora Acquisition Corp. via a SPAC (special purpose acquisition) has been approved by shareholders. The company had originally begun making plans to go public in May 2021 but was plagued with layoffs, high-profile executive resignations, a housing market slowdown and negative publicity that forced it to push back its IPO. Baldur’s Gate 3, reviewed:  Baldur’s Gate 3 is a Dungeons & Dragons game through and through, Taylor reports in her first impressions piece, but you needn’t be familiar with that world or those systems to enjoy it. Whether you want to smooch vampires or watch the world burn, the game’s a role-playing experience like no other, she writes. A smart ring to compete with Oura: Indian fitness and nutrition tracking startup Ultrahuman has fast-followed its debut smart ring last year with a second generation of the device, which officially launched in June. Natasha, who reviewed it for TC, found it to be an improvement upon the original in several ways, including (very importantly) in the form-factor department. An EV battery with greater range: CATL, the Chinese battery giant and a major supplier to Tesla, has unveiled its latest product that aims to solve electric vehicles’ charging and range limitations. Dubbed Shenxing, or “god-like movement,” the battery is able to refuel up to 400 kilometers (250 miles) of range in 10 minutes. In need of some listening material to entertain and inform? Look no further than TechCrunch’s growing stable of podcast episodes. On Equity, the crew kicked off with an update on former FTX exec Sam Bankman-Fried heading to jail, then got into Better.com going public, Monday.com’s growth, Vinfast adding to the SPAC list, the Inflation Reduction Act’s anniversary and two bright spots in 2023’s venture landscape. Meanwhile, Found spotlighted Marco Zappacosta, the co-founder and CEO of Thumbtack, a startup that runs a marketplace for home services and beyond. Zappacosta talked about his unusual path to entrepreneurship, which included almost getting a degree in neuroscience before deciding to start a company without having an existing idea. And Chain Reaction spoke with Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, alongside TechCrunch+ editor in chief Alex Wilhelm. Among other things, they dove into what’s going on with the bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S., why it matters and the odds of the SEC approving one in the near future. TC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys — which you know if you’re already a subscriber. If you’re not, consider signing up. Here are a few highlights from this week: A surprisingly strong jobs market: After the big companies conducted mega layoffs at the beginning of this year, it would be natural to think that the tech unemployment rate would skyrocket. But Ron writes about how — if we think about tech jobs as comprising purely IT, engineering and developer kinds of roles — then those jobs are definitely still in demand and less affected than you might imagine. What do CTOs do, exactly?: Haje writes about how technical blind spots mean investors are guiding founders in the wrong direction. Premature optimization isn’t helpful to anyone. But having a CTO with the right experience, knowledge and expertise for the stage a company is at appears to be examined only rarely in the investment process. A room-temperature superconductor? Not so fast: If there was any hope remaining that LK-99 might be a room-temperature superconductor, it’s pretty much dead now. Tim writes that dozens of studies published in the last week or two have coalesced around this conclusion, less than a month after a sensational preprint paper was published by a team at the Quantum Energy Research Centre.

2023-08-19,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/19/subscriptions-saas-india/,TechCrunch,Nailing subscriptions in India,"W
elcome to the TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the daily TechCrunch+ column where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here. Today I’m looking at subscriptions in India from two angles: the consumer market and B2B SaaS. — Anna A recent story by my colleague Jagmeet Singh about a wearables launch caught my eye because neither of the two new smart rings launched in the Indian market would employ a subscription-based model. Subscriptions are a tough sell for wearables (and hardware in general), because you have to keep paying even as the device gets older. That’s still the model that incumbent Oura shifted to, arguing that this allows it to continually add new features. Its user base wasn’t happy about the switch, though. In contrast, BoAt, one of the two companies launching a smart ring in India, is aiming for a price tag below $80. That’s much lower than Oura’s $299 starting price, and it doesn’t even include the subscription.  "
2023-08-19,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/19/cellebrite-asks-cops-to-keep-its-phone-hacking-tech-hush-hush/,TechCrunch,Cellebrite asks cops to keep its phone hacking tech ‘hush hush’,"For years, cops and other government authorities all over the world have been using phone hacking technology provided by Cellebrite to unlock phones and obtain the data within. And the company has been keen on keeping the use of its technology “hush hush.” As part of the deal with government agencies, Cellebrite asks users to keep its tech — and the fact that they used it — secret, TechCrunch has learned. This request concerns legal experts who argue that powerful technology like the one Cellebrite builds and sells, and how it gets used by law enforcement agencies, ought to be public and scrutinized. In a leaked training video for law enforcement customers that was obtained by TechCrunch, a senior Cellebrite employee tells customers that “ultimately, you’ve extracted the data, it’s the data that solves the crime, how you got in, let’s try to keep that as hush hush as possible.” “We don’t really want any techniques to leak in court through disclosure practices, or you know, ultimately in testimony, when you are sitting in the stand, producing all this evidence and discussing how you got into the phone,” the employee, who we are not naming, says in the video. For legal experts, this kind of request is troubling because authorities need to be transparent in order for a judge to authorize searches, or to authorize the use of certain data and evidence in court. Secrecy, the experts argue, hurts the rights of defendants, and ultimately the rights of the public. “The results these super-secretive products spit out are used in court to try to prove whether someone is guilty of a crime,” Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at the Stanford University’s Internet Observatory, told TechCrunch. “The accused (whether through their lawyers or through an expert) must have the ability to fully understand how Cellebrite devices work, examine them and determine whether they functioned properly or contained flaws that might have affected the results.” “And anyone testifying about those products under oath must not hide important information that could help exonerate a criminal defendant solely to protect the business interests of some company,” said Pfefferkorn. Hanni Fakhoury, a criminal defense attorney who has studied surveillance technology for years, told TechCrunch that “the reason why that stuff needs to be disclosed, is the defense needs to be able to figure out ‘was there a legal problem in how this evidence was obtained? Do I have the ability to challenge that?’” The Cellebrite employee claims in the video that disclosing the use of its technology could help criminals and make the lives of law enforcement agencies harder. “It’s super important to keep all these capabilities as protected as possible, because ultimately leakage can be harmful to the entire law enforcement community globally,” the Cellebrite employee says in the video. “We want to ensure that widespread knowledge of these capabilities does not spread. And if the bad guys find out how we’re getting into a device, or that we’re able to decrypt a particular encrypted messaging app, while they might move on to something much, much more difficult or impossible to overcome, we definitely don’t want that.” Cellebrite spokesperson Victor Cooper said in an email to TechCrunch that the company “is committed to support ethical law enforcement. Our tools are designed for lawful use, with the utmost respect for the chain of custody and judicial process.” “We do not advise our customers to act in contravention with any law, legal requirements or other forensics standards,” the spokesperson said. “While we continue protecting and expect users of our tools to respect our trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information, we also permanently continue developing our training and other published materials for the purpose of identifying statements which could be improperly interpreted by listeners, and in this respect, we thank you for bringing this to our attention.” When asked whether Cellebrite would change the content of its training, the spokesperson did not respond. The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s senior staff attorney Saira Hussain and senior staff technologist Cooper Quintin told TechCrunch in an email that “Cellebrite is helping create a world where authoritarian countries, criminal groups, and cyber-mercenaries also are able to exploit these vulnerable devices and commit crimes, silence opposition, and invade people’s privacy.” Cellebrite is not the first company that asks its customers to keep its technology secret. For years, government contractor Harris Corporation made law enforcement agencies who wanted to use its cellphone surveillance tool, known as stingrays, sign a non-disclosure agreement that in some cases suggested dropping cases rather than disclosing what tools the authorities used. These requests go as far back as the mid 2010s, but are still in force today.

2023-08-19,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/19/parade-dtc-acquisition-market-conditions/,TechCrunch,Deal Dive: Forecasting rain on DTC’s Parade," You don’t need me to tell you that startups haven’t been doing great since the funding slowdown and valuation reset started back in 2022. But while some companies will be able to survive on cash reserves or be propped up on inside funding, others will be forced to either liquidate or exit under less-than-ideal circumstances. Such is the case with Parade, which earlier this week was acquired by Ariela & Associates International, a more prominent player in the intimates space. Ariela & Associates also owns Fruit of the Loom, if that gives you any indication of how prominent it is. Parade could not be reached for comment by press time. Parade was founded in 2019 as a direct-to-consumer (DTC) startup that looked to go against the Victoria’s Secret–inspired norms of the intimates industry by offering sustainable, comfortable intimates in a wide range of sizing options. The startup was last valued at $203 million in September 2022, according to data from PitchBook, after raising $56 million in venture funding from firms such as Maveron, Vice Ventures and Lerer Hippeau, among others. And while we don’t know the terms of the deal, it’s safe to assume that in today’s market, if a company were getting acquired for a solid exit, it would be shouting it from the rooftops. Investors would be putting out a press release to celebrate the return they made, and there would have been interviews booked in advance so the company could brag about how this was the perfect next step. The lack of pomp and circumstance from the folks who had potential to make money off the deal is telling; we know better than to assume the best in a market like today’s.  "
2023-08-19,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/19/this-week-in-ai-amazon-enhances-reviews-with-ai-while-snaps-goes-rogue/,TechCrunch,This week in AI: Amazon ‘enhances’ reviews with AI while Snap’s goes rogue,"Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as AI is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of the last week’s stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own. This week in AI, Amazon announced that it’ll begin tapping generative AI to “enhance” product reviews. Once it rolls out, the feature will provide a short paragraph of text on the product detail page that highlights the product capabilities and customer sentiment mentioned across the reviews. Sounds like a useful feature, no? Perhaps for shoppers and sellers. But what about reviewers? I’m not going to make the case that Amazon reviews are a form of high art. On the contrary, a fair number on the platform aren’t real — or are AI-generated themselves. But some reviewers, whether out of genuine concern for their fellow shopper or an effort to get the creative juices flowing, put time into crafting reviews that not only inform, but entertain. Summaries of these reviews would do them an injustice — and miss the point entirely. Perhaps you’ve stumbled upon these gems. Often, they’re found in the review sections for books and movies, where, in my anecdotal experience, Amazon reviewers tend to be more… verbose. Image Credits: Amazon Take Amazon user “Sweet Home’s” review of J. D. Salinger’s “Catcher in the Rye,” which clocks in at over 2,000 words. Referencing the works of William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac as well as George Bernard Shaw, Gary Snyder and Dorothy Parker, Sweet Home’s review is less a review than a thorough analysis, picking at and contextualizing the novel’s threads in an attempt to explain its staying power. And then there’s Bryan Desmond’s review of “Gravity’s Rainbow,” the infamously dense Thomas Pynchon novel. Similarly wordy — 1,120 words — it not only underlines the book’s highlights (dazzling prose) and lowlights (outdated attitudes, particularly toward women), as one would expect from a review, but relays in great detail Desmond’s experience of reading it. Could AI summarize those? Sure. But at the expense of nuance and insight. Of course, Amazon doesn’t intend to hide reviews from view in favor of AI-generated summaries. But I fear that reviewers will be less inclined to spend nearly as much time and attention if their work goes increasingly unread by the average shopper. It’s a grand experiment, and I suppose — as with most of what generative AI touches — only time will tell. Here are some other AI stories of note from the past few days: I (that is, thine co-author Devin) was at SIGGRAPH this last week, where AI, despite being a bogeyman in the film and TV industry right now, was in full force as both a tool and research subject. I’ll have a longer story soon about how it’s being used by VFX artists in innovative and totally uncontroversial ways soon, but the papers on display were also pretty great. This session in particular had several interesting new ideas. Image Credits: Tel Aviv University Image generating models have this weird thing where if you tell them to draw “a white cat and a black dog,” it often mixes the two up, ignores one or makes a catdog or animals that are both black and white. An approach from Tel Aviv University called “attend and excite” sorts the prompt into its constituent pieces through attention, and then makes sure the resulting image contains proper representations of each. The result is a model much better at parsing multi-subject prompts. I’d expect to see something like this integrated into art generators soon! Image Credits: MIT/Max Planck Institute Another weakness of generative art models is that if you want to make small changes, like the subject looking a little more to the side, you have to redo the whole thing — sometimes losing what you liked about the image to begin with. “Drag Your GAN” is a pretty astonishing tool that lets the user set and move points one by one or several at a time — as you can see in the image, a lion’s head can be turned, or its mouth opened, by regenerating just that portion of the image to accord with the new proportions. Google is in the author list so you can bet they’re looking at how to use this. Image Credits: Tel Aviv University This “semantic typography” paper is more fun, but also extremely clever. By treating each letter as a vector image and nudging that image toward a vector image of the object a word refers to, it creates pretty impressive logotypes. If you’re stuck on how to turn your company name into a visual pun, this could be a great way to get started. Elsewhere, we have some interesting cross-pollination between brain science and AI. Well, it’s not quite this simple. Image Credits: UC Berkeley These Berkeley researchers used a machine learning model to interpret brain activity while listening to music, and reconstruct some of the clusters that were focused on rhythm, melody or vocals. I’m always skeptical of this kind of “we read the brain” type studies, so take it all with a grain of salt, but ML is great at isolating a signal in noise, and brain activity is very, very noisy. MIT and Harvard teamed up to try to advance our understanding of astrocytes, cells in the brain that perform some as-yet-unknown function. They propose that the cells may act as something like a transformer or attention mechanism — a machine learning concept being mapped onto the brain rather than vice versa! Senior paper author Dmitry Krotov from MIT sums it up well: In medical AI, data from consumer devices is often considered noisy as well, or unreliable. But again, ML systems can adapt, as this new paper from Yale shows. The research should move us closer to wearables that warn us of heart-related issues before they become acute. Students demonstrate their empty chair finding app. Image Credits: EPFL One of GPT-4’s first practical applications was use in Be My Eyes, an app that helps blind folks navigate with the help of a remote partner. EPFL students developed two more apps that could be pretty nice for anyone with a visual impairment. One simply directs the user toward an empty seat in a room, and the other reads off only the relevant info from medicine bottles: the active ingredient, dosage, etc. Such simple but necessary tasks! Lastly we have the toddler-equivalent “RoboAgent” developed by CMU and Meta, which aims to learn everyday skills like picking things up or understanding object interactions just by looking and touching things — the way a child does. “An agent capable of this sort of learning moves us closer to a general robot that can complete a variety of tasks in diverse unseen settings and continually evolve as it gathers more experiences,” said CMU’s Shubham Tulsiani.

2023-08-19,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/19/how-index-ventures-jumped-to-the-front-of-the-ai-gpu-line/,TechCrunch,How Index Ventures jumped to the front of the AI GPU line,"Earlier this week, The New York Times shone a light on some of the desperation that founders are experiencing as they try and fail to secure compute power for their nascent artificial intelligence startups, thanks to the big companies (and even rich nations) racing to snatch them up. One founder reportedly said of the graphics processing units, or GPUs, that he needs for his company: “I think about [them] as a rare earth metal at this point.” According to that Times piece, founders are trying numerous measures to amass the chips, including calling in favors from friends at large equipment vendors that might have GPUs to spare, and navigating an obscure U.S. government program called Access. At least one firm, the global investor Index Ventures, happened on an additional idea, it told the outlet. To help ensure its portfolio companies aren’t hamstrung by the shortage, it struck a deal with Oracle to provide its founders with some of these sought-after chips (specifically Nvidia’s H100 chips and Nvidia’s A100 chips). To learn more about the arrangement — one that other venture firms are undoubtedly trying to replicate — we talked earlier today with Erin Price-Wright, a Bay Area-based partner with Index who focuses on enterprise software and AI and who, before joining the venture firm in 2019, was the head of product for Palantir’s data analytics and machine learning platform. Excerpts from our chat have been lightly edited for length and clarity below; you can hear our longer conversation here. TechCrunch: Tell us about this partnership with Oracle.  Erin Price-Wright: Access to compute is one of the biggest challenges that AI companies face, and it’s especially hard for an early-stage company to get their hands on GPUs. It’s less about the cost in particular but the fact that something like more than 95% of GPU capacity is already allocated to large players in this space [because] they make these pretty big pre-commitments with cloud vendors. So if you’re an early-stage company, and you’re just trying to get started training, or fine tuning the model, there’s usually a really long lead time between when GPUs are even available. It can be three months to a year in some cases and it’s really hard to just get started. If you’re an early-stage company that’s still figuring out what your product is, you don’t even know how many GPUs you need. So even that process of discovery of understanding what your workloads are going to look like can be super challenging for early-stage companies. So we’re partnering with Oracle to provide GPUs to our earliest-stage portfolio companies, because we want to help remove that barrier of access so that they can really focus on what matters from day zero. Ultimately, the goal is to help all of these companies graduate to their own cluster. We’re not in the business of providing these massive GPU clusters to our companies. . .but we really want to give them a head start, so that they can start building faster as a way to help level the playing field. How did the deal come together? We wanted to make sure that people who are building against very tangible business problems didn’t feel like they had to change their business model or change the way they were representing themselves or change the way they were fundraising in order to just get access to GPUs. So it was really born out of seeing this pattern again and again with early-stage companies where we were like, ‘This is where Index as a fund actually has real leverage. And we can use our position in the market, our relationships, and the fact that we can kind of aggregate this demand across multiple companies to really provide value-additive services’ [to our founders]. Did Index put a down payment together or has it purchased chips outright from Oracle? Are you giving Oracle a stake in these startups? We’re not purchasing any chips outright. So the partnership with Oracle is that Index makes the precommitment on the behalf of our startups and pays the cloud bill. Oracle manages the cluster — they’ve been a fantastic partner — and then our companies get access to that GPU cluster for free. So you’re paying [this cloud bill] in advance. Did you have to talk with your own investors about that? That’s not typical of what [a venture firm] would do historically. In terms of the actual structure of how the agreement works, I’ll probably hold off on sharing too many of those details. Is this an exclusive relationship? Is there anything to prevent other venture firms from doing the same thing? Yeah, of course [they could do the same], there certainly isn’t [an exclusive relationship with Index]. One benefit that Oracle gets out of it is to meet the next generation of fantastic companies as early as possible. In the process of using our GPU cluster, we’re actively helping our companies navigate the process of signing their own dedicated cloud deal. So the idea is not for them to [do] this in perpetuity; it’s for them to develop relationships with Oracle and AWS and the other large cloud providers and sign their own dedicated contract. One of your portfolio companies, Cohere, counts Oracle as one of its backers along with Nvidia, which are two of the companies you most want to have involved with your portfolio companies right now. One of the ways we really can help our portfolio companies is making sure they’re connected to the right people at the right time, so that they get the resources they need. Index has at least 20 portfolio companies that fall into the AI/ML bucket, including Cohere [which has already raised $445 million] and another company that recently raised a huge seed round, Mistral AI in France. Is too much money being invested broadly in generative AI or are we still in the ‘early innings,’ as VCs like to say? We are in the early innings. I do think we’re rapidly entering a cooling off period in terms of sentiment, especially for some of these very large rounds and especially from traditional VCs. There’s still a really big gap between the promise and power of the core models of technology and what it’s going to take for them to be actually used and useful across many use cases in the enterprise. There’s just a huge infrastructure gap missing that needs to be filled, and it’s not going to be filled overnight; it’s going to take some time. Over the coming 12 months, while I’m still very excited about the power of the core technology and how transformational it’s going to be for the world, I think we’re going to see a little bit of a backing off as companies really grapple with it, figure out the ROI, kind of prioritize use cases and start actually building real things beyond maybe the one or two prototype demo apps that they’ve been working on for the last six months. That’s when we’re going to start seeing the infrastructure emerge that’s going to start supporting these use cases at scale. How do you as an investor ensure that your AI companies don’t overlap? And is that any harder or more difficult than when it comes to traditional startups? I don’t think it’s massively different than how we think about competition elsewhere. Everyone paints AI as this standalone category. But if I look forward even two years, let alone five or 10, every single piece of software that we use will have AI as its beating heart. There will be no piece of code, no software, no application, no website that you visit, that doesn’t have AI as a core component of it. I almost think about it like SaaS. Is every single SaaS company the same? No. Every single SaaS company has a database, every single SaaS company has a front end, every single SaaS company has some interaction between the two. AI is kind of similar to a database in that respect. It’s just kind of a core building block in how you build software. We’re very early in the market, so there’s going to be some movement and some change as companies figure out how to use these tools and what specific problems to go after. But it’s not different than how we think about traditional SaaS investing from my perspective."
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/cruise-told-by-regulators-to-immediately-reduce-robotaxi-fleet-50-following-crash/,TechCrunch,Cruise told by regulators to ‘immediately’ reduce robotaxi fleet 50% following crash,"Cruise, the self-driving car subsidiary of GM, has been asked to reduce its robotaxi fleet by 50% in San Francisco following a crash Thursday night with a fire truck. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles in the state, requested the reduction in operations. The state agency said it is investigating “recent concerning incidents” involving Cruise vehicles in San Francisco. It called for Cruise to reduce its fleet by 50% and have no more than 50 driverless vehicles in operation during the day and 150 driverless vehicles in operation at night until the investigation is complete. “Safety of the traveling public is the California DMV’s top priority,” the DMV said in a statement issued Friday evening, adding that it has the right, following the investigation, to suspend or revoke testing and/or deployment permits if it determines there’s an unreasonable risk to public safety. “The primary focus of the DMV’s regulations is the safe operation of autonomous vehicles and safety of the public who share the road with these vehicles.” Cruise told TechCrunch it is complying with the request. Cruise also issued a blog post giving the company’s perspective of how and why the crash occurred. “Over one hundred people lose their lives every day on American roadways, and countless others are badly injured, Cruise said in a statement sent via email. “We believe it’s clear that Cruise positively impacts overall road safety, and look forward to working with the CA DMV to make any improvements and provide any data they need to reinforce the safety and efficiency of our fleet.” Cruise has had a series of snafus, including at least 10 of its driverless cars reportedly stalling and blocking traffic, which threatens to derail its commercial plans. The string of glitches come just a week after winning approval from the California Public Utilities Commission to expand commercial operations in San Francisco. The CPUC, the agency that regulates ride-hailing operations including those involving robotaxis, approved Cruise and Waymo on August 10 for final permits that allow the companies to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, expand their fleets and charge for rides throughout the city. The latest Cruise incident occurred Thursday night when a Cruise robotaxi and an emergency vehicle crashed and left a passenger injured. Cruise said in a social media post that one of its self-driving Chevy Bolt EVs entered an intersection on a green traffic light at Polk and Turk streets when it was struck by an emergency vehicle that appeared to be en route to an emergency scene. Earlier this week, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu filed motions with the CPUC to pause Cruise and Waymo’s plans to charge for robotaxi rides in the city at all hours. Chiu’s arguments parallel comments made by residents and other city officials during a public hearing ahead of the CPUC’s vote."
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/zepotha-1980s-horror-fake-movie-tiktok-goncharov-tumblr/,TechCrunch,"Zepotha is huge on TikTok, but it’s no Goncharov","The seminal 1987 horror film “Zepotha” is back on TikTok. Reaction videos to the film’s gory forest scenes dominate user feeds. TikTok users are digging through their parents’ wardrobes to recreate the vintage outfits from the movie. Fanart of the characters and convoluted theories about the movie’s ambiguous ending keep going viral. The tag #Zepotha has nearly 160 million views, and the movie’s theme song — an ethereal, synth-heavy pop beat — is trending.  If you don’t remember Zepotha, you’re not alone. Zepotha never existed.  It’s all part of a clever marketing campaign to promote a new song by the musical artist Emily Jeffri. The 18-year-old singer posted a video about making a fake movie go viral on TikTok by dropping casual mentions of it without any context. She encouraged followers to tell other creators that they “look EXACTLY like the girl from Zepotha” to stir up confusion. Her original video has 7.6 million views. In another video, she recommended bringing up Zepotha “every time a film bro mocks you” to gaslight them into believing that the movie is real.  Zepotha is a massive inside joke on TikTok — if you know, you know.  “Together we will witness new lore develop, main characters will emerge, etc,” Jeffri said in a TikTok posted over the weekend. “We can convince thousands of people that this weirdly titled 80s horror film actually exists.”  The trend is working. Within days, the sound featuring Jeffri’s new song was used in over 12,000 videos. Other users leaned into the joke, claiming that they wrote extensive, smutty fanfiction about the film’s tragic protagonists. Fans posted “trailers” of Zepotha, and spread rumors about a 2024 reboot. They posted fake eBay listings for “rare” Zepotha VHS tapes and mint condition posters. When other users expressed doubt or confusion about the movie, Zepotha truthers insisted that their parents had shown them the movie as children.  “I did NOT watch Zepotha and become traumatized for them to just say we made it up,” a user commented on a TikTok about the movie.  “old person here (30) i definitely saw a glimpse of zepotha at blockbuster back in the 90s,” another said. “so I CAN CONFIRM IT’S REAL.”  Going viral on TikTok was once a perk that fast-tracked artists to making it in the music industry. Now, it’s an expectation. Artists tease previews of their new singles for weeks before actually releasing them, in hopes of manufacturing a trend to accompany their music. Last year, Halsey complained that her label wouldn’t let her release a new song without a “fake” viral moment. Organic virality is possible, but makes TikTok users suspicious. The platform is so saturated with new music that up-and-coming artists are written off as industry plants before they even have the chance to prove otherwise. TikTok users are wary of anyone who claims to have written “the song of the summer” or “the post-breakup song,” especially if the music they wrote conforms to the “TikTok music formula” — pop music made to go viral.  Sharing any kind of art is an act of vulnerability, but especially so for independent musicians on TikTok. Sharing too earnestly is cringe, and sharing too proudly is artificial. One of the few strategies that actually works is for artists to market to niche internet communities, like fan edits of tragic gay anime pairings.  Jeffri’s campaign is particularly clever because it builds a trend that happens to feature her song, instead of forcing her song into a trend. Zepotha is bigger than her song, at this point, and the more it spreads, the more removed it is from Jeffri herself. Zepotha is an inside joke, but few TikTok users know how the joke started. Knowing who Jeffri is doesn’t matter, though; as long as the videos use Jeffri’s song, her campaign is working.  While the strategy works to draw in new listeners, Jeffri’s claim over the trend also limits Zepotha from achieving its potential as a collaborative bit.  Collectively gaslighting the internet into remembering a fake movie isn’t new. Last year, Tumblr “brought back” the 1973 Martin Scorsese drama “Goncharov,” an Italian mafia film that revolved around crime, power and a forbidden love triangle. Like Zepotha, Goncharov never existed. But Tumblr users committed to the bit, and created a detailed Google doc about the film’s characters, their relationships and their backstories. The collaborative effort also included a scene-by-scene breakdown of the movie, which users coordinated through a Goncharov Discord server.  Scorsese himself joined in, and in a text to his daughter posted on TikTok, said, “I made that film years ago.”  While Zepotha is popular, it hasn’t reached the commitment to detail or collaboration that Goncharov did. Tumblr users have criticized Zepotha as a disorganized popularity contest, rather than a collective effort. Multiple creators started Google docs to write Zepotha’s lore together, but failed to agree on a singular story. There is no definitive list of characters featured in the film, and the names that TikTok creators do reference in their Zepotha posts vary in spelling.  “Zepotha will never succeed because tiktok users don’t have the attentions spans to pull off a goncharov,” Tumblr user sbibble said. “Meanwhile we have nothing better to do and decades of fan fiction experience.”  Zepotha’s greatest flaw isn’t the lack of centralized lore — it’s that, unlike Goncharov, a single creator is claiming ownership of the joke. This week, Jeffri announced a short film competition that would award the winner £500. The winning film would also become “canon” in the Zepotha universe.  “as the creator of zepotha i feel it is important that we restore order & organise our lore,” Jeffri said in the video announcing the short film competition. “time for you, the REAL creative geniuses behind all of this, to bring zepotha to life in your own short movies.”  Goncharov worked so well because countless users worked on it together. Fans discussed plot points for hours at a time on Discord before writing them into the shared Google doc, which canonized the lore. Tumblr users wrote detailed analyses of the film’s themes and clock motifs, based on other users’ additions to the Google doc. Goncharov writers went as far as agreeing that scenes in the film had to be compliant with the period-appropriate Hays Code, the industry guidelines that prohibited nudity, profanity and realistic violence. Tumblr users created a definitive story from thousands of ideas.  Zepotha, on the other hand, is an idea with a single origin point that has branched off into countless deviating storylines. Choosing a single winning short film to decide the film’s plot encourages fans to compete with each other, instead of build on each others’ creativity. It isn’t inherently better or worse than how Goncharov creators worked, but does limit Zepotha’s impact on internet culture. Zepotha is so popular because it’s fun to be in on the joke, not necessarily because of the creative potential.  The Goncharov hype lasted for weeks, and although it’s slowed down in the past year, the Discord server is still active. Jeffri posted about Zepotha less than a week ago, but users are already tiring of the trend.  Whether Zepotha lasts doesn’t matter as much for Jeffri. It doesn’t need to be the next Goncharov for her to make an impact. She already managed to make her song viral, and for an independent artist on TikTok, that’s enough of a win."
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/ai2-drops-biggest-open-dataset-yet-for-training-language-models/,TechCrunch,AI2 drops biggest open dataset yet for training language models,"Language models like GPT-4 and Claude are powerful and useful, but the data on which they are trained is a closely guarded secret. The Allen Institute for AI (AI2) aims to reverse this trend with a new, huge text dataset that’s free to use and open to inspection. Dolma, as the dataset is called, is intended to be the basis for the research group’s planned open language model, or OLMo (Dolma is short for “Data to feed OLMo’s Appetite). As the model is intended to be free to use and modify by the AI research community, so too (argue AI2 researchers) should be the dataset they use to create it. This is the first “data artifact” AI2 is making available pertaining to OLMo, and in a blog post, the organization’s Luca Soldaini explains the choice of sources and rationale behind various processes the team used to render it palatable for AI consumption. (“A more comprehensive paper is in the works,” they note at the outset.) Although companies like OpenAI and Meta publish some of the vital statistics of the datasets they use to build their language models, a lot of that information is treated as proprietary. Apart from the known consequence of discouraging scrutiny and improvement at large, there is speculation that perhaps this closed approach is due to the data not being ethically or legally obtained: for instance, that pirated copies of many authors’ books are ingested. You can see in this chart created by AI2 that the largest and most recent models only provide some of the information that a researcher would likely want to know about a given dataset. What information was removed, and why? What was considered high versus low-quality text? Were personal details appropriately excised? Chart showing different datasets’ openness or lack thereof. Image Credits: AI2 Of course it is these companies’ prerogative, in the context of a fiercely competitive AI landscape, to guard the secrets of their models’ training processes. But for researchers outside the companies, it makes those datasets and models more opaque and difficult to study or replicate. AI2’s Dolma is intended to be the opposite of these, with all its sources and processes — say, how and why it was trimmed to original English language texts — publicly documented. It’s not the first to try the open dataset thing, but it is the largest by far (3 billion tokens, an AI-native measure of content volume) and, they claim, the most straightforward in terms of use and permissions. It uses the “ImpACT license for medium-risk artifacts,” which you can see the details about here. But essentially it requires prospective users of Dolma to: For those who worry that despite AI2’s best efforts, some personal data of theirs may have made it into the database, there’s a removal request form available here. It’s for specific cases, not just a general “don’t use me” thing. If that all sounds good to you, access to Dolma is available via Hugging Face."
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/roblox-children-gambling-class-action-lawsuit-robux/,TechCrunch,Roblox faces a new class action lawsuit alleging it facilitates child gambling,"In a new class action lawsuit filed in the Northern District of California this week, two parents accuse Roblox of illegally facilitating child gambling. While gambling is not allowed on the platform, which hosts millions of virtual games that cater to children and teens, the lawsuit points to third-party gambling sites that invite users to play blackjack, slots, roulette and other games of chance using Roblox’s in-game currency. The lawsuit, first reported by Bloomberg Law, was filed on behalf of plaintiffs Rachel Colvin and Danielle Sass, two mothers with children who have gambled on third-party sites that tie into Roblox’s virtual currency, Robux. Both parents claim that their children, named as minor plaintiffs in the suit, have lost thousands of Robux gambling on those sites without their knowledge (Robux currently sells 800 Robux on its website for $9.99 with deeper discounts for larger amounts of the digital currency). The lawsuit specifically names RBXFlip, Bloxflip and RBLXWild as participants in “an illegal gambling operation that is preying on children nationwide.” The owners of those sites are named as defendants along with Roblox itself. RBXFlip, which entices players with “fun and fair games,” has been on the radar of the Roblox community since at least 2019 and continues to operate today. Roblox itself is a vast collection of virtual experiences and not a game in a traditional sense. Those experiences, crafted by amateur and professional developers alike, can lightly depict gambling by showing casinos or non-player card dealers, for example, but “experiences that include simulated gambling, including playing with virtual chips, simulated betting, or exchanging real money, Robux, or in-experience items of value are not allowed.” The plaintiffs call those rules misleading, given Roblox’s apparent tolerance for third-party betting sites. “In its Terms of Service, Roblox misleadingly represents to parents and other users that its platform and digital currency are safe,” the lawsuit states. “… This representation is false, or misleading at best.” Bloxflip ad on X, formerly Twitter The lawsuit alleges that Roblox maintains control over the flow of Robux and therefore has full knowledge of shady, third-party gambling sites that entice kids to play with the in-game currency. “Roblox could, of course, prohibit and/or stop the Gambling Website Defendants from utilizing the Roblox ecosystem and digital currency to facilitate illegal gambling but it does not,” the lawsuit states, accusing the company of profiting from the scheme in the millions by drawing a 30 percent fee on transactions, those included. In an email to TechCrunch, Roblox declined to answer specific questions, but emphasized that the gambling sites are in no way affiliated with Roblox. “Bad actors make illegal use of Roblox’s intellectual property and branding to operate such sites in violation of our standards,” the company wrote in a statement. “… Ensuring a safe and compliant online experience for users of Roblox is a core tenant of the company. Roblox will continue to be vigilant in combating entities who engage in practices that are in violation of our policies or endanger the safety of our community.” Roblox also pointed out that it has dedicated teams that investigate websites like those named in the lawsuit and in some instances may pursue having those sites removed. But given the company’s wording here, it’s not clear that Roblox views these established third-party gambling sites as violating its terms of service by using Robux for underage gambling off-platform. Roblox has certainly had plenty of time to pursue legal action against these sites or otherwise close up the loopholes that make them possible. Update: In an email to TechCrunch, Roblox Corporate Communications Director Cris Paden clarified that gambling sites using Robux do violate the platform’s community standards and terms of service. Paden pointed TechCrunch to its rules prohibiting “experiences that include simulated gambling, including playing with virtual chips, simulated betting, or exchanging real money, Robux, or in-experience items of value,” which the company interprets as applicable to off-Roblox uses of the platform’s currency as well as more traditional on-platform experiences. Roblox declined to confirm or deny if the company has pursued legal action against the websites named in the lawsuit, citing the pending litigation. “… It’s not accurate to suggest that if the site is live we aren’t fighting them,” Paden said. While Roblox disallows in-game gambling, it does encourage a few other notorious forms of virtual commerce. Many Roblox experiences entice young players with lootboxes — randomized virtual goods paid with real money via in-game currency. Lootboxes are still legal in the U.S. but they have been outlawed in countries like the Netherlands. The practice may be due for an EU-wide crackdown that will have broad ripple effects for game developers who choose to juice revenues with the lucrative, predatory practice. Roblox also added support for limited edition virtual items in recent years, allowing developers to offer special virtual goods sold in numbered quantities. Limiteds offer developers another source of revenue, but their NFT-like appeal — and Roblox’s decision to foster a full Robux-based trading economy — does raise eyebrows given that the platform centers children and teens, at least for now.

2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/is-jpmorgan-turning-a-corner-on-climate-finance/,TechCrunch,Is JPMorgan turning a corner on climate finance?,"Let’s get this out of the way: JPMorgan Chase doesn’t have the best reputation in the climate sector. Since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2016, the bank has financed more than $430 billion worth of fossil fuel projects, according to the most recent Banking on Climate Chaos report, far exceeding its peers. But there’s some evidence to suggest the bank is turning a corner. In 2021, JPMorgan said it would lend and underwrite $2.5 trillion by the end of the decade “to advance long-term solutions that address climate change and contribute to sustainable development.” Of that, it’s earmarking $1 trillion specifically for climate investments. Part of JPMorgan’s focus on sustainability is undoubtedly a reaction to changing political and consumer sentiment around the climate and the adverse impact on people. Just in the U.S., the past few years have seen people suffering unavoidable and unprecedented heat waves, with fires raging through towns and forests, not to mention the extreme floods and snowstorms ravaging some areas. At first, ESG (environmental, social, governance) investing felt like a supplemental action at many investment firms. It is clear that can no longer be the case. In 2022, the bank hired Osei Van Horne and Tanya Barnes to oversee its climate investments, and added Alex Bell to the company earlier this year. The team has been working to implement the bank’s ambitious plans, focusing on growth-stage investments. The bank has made two investments so far: It led a $42 million Series E in MineSense Technologies, which focuses on critical minerals, and a $200 million Series E in Arcadia, a renewable energy platform for consumers and businesses. JPMorgan’s stamp of approval shows that the sector is both one of the most urgent and most promising investment opportunities of this generation. So far this year, climate companies have raised $8.3 billion. In 2021, such companies raised $17.85 billion, and the total fell only slightly in 2022. All of these sums are substantially higher than what the sector received in 2019 — just $3.2 billion. “This is an extraordinarily large and attractive place to deploy capital,” Van Horne, a managing partner at JPMorgan, told TechCrunch+. “It’s also a great opportunity for startup founders.” "
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/bluesky-buckled-following-twitter-xs-announcement-about-the-end-of-blocks/,TechCrunch,Bluesky buckled following Twitter/X’s announcement about the end of blocks,"Twitter, er X, competitor Bluesky buckled following Elon Musk’s announcement that X will no longer support the “block” function in favor of mutes only. Users on Bluesky were seeing issues with slow load times and the occasional error message when trying to view posts. Images and graphics were also slow to load. In addition, the site’s status page indicated an issue affecting performance was being investigated. The company has often had to deal with the influx of users when Twitter announces a particularly unwelcome change, and that could be the case here — though members of the Bluesky team have not yet confirmed what’s causing the issues at hand or whether the timing is coincidental. However, data from a source that leverages the Bluesky API to track new user registrations indicates that the decentralized social media platform has seen 5,616 new registrations in the past 24 hours, compared with 536 in the 24 hours preceding this. So it could be that more people suddenly cashed in their invite codes. Image Credits: twexit.nl (opens in a new window) The Bluesky status page, meanwhile, published a message that it’s seeing degraded PDS performance, and noted, “We are currently investigating this issue.” That’s not very helpful information, but the AT Protocol docs (the protocol behind Bluesky’s app) describe PDS as a “Personal Data Server” or “PDS,” which “acts as an account’s trusted agent in the network, routes client network requests, and hosts repositories.”  Techmeme CEO Gabe Rivera also noted that his news sites had to stop posting to Bluesky as they were timing out when trying to use Bluesky’s APIs. Bluesky’s issues seem to be slowly resolving, we’ve found over the past several minutes. As we updated the status page, a new note appeared. Bluesky now indicates it has “fixed the main problem,” but added that “some images may not be loading” and said a fix is in progress. Meanwhile, over on X, both Bluesky and Threads are trending terms suggesting another Twitter/X exodus could soon be underway as users react to the startling news. Though there’s not a reliable way to track Bluesky’s performance outside of the status page, Twitter has often been the source of referrals to the rival network. According to data from Similarweb, a few months ago 86% of social referrals to the Bluesky app’s website (bsky.app) were coming from twitter.com. Over the past 28 days, that figure dropped to 78.8%. Total daily traffic also dropped from a peak in mid-July, the firm said. Recently, X slowed down referral traffic to various websites including its competition, like Threads and Bluesky. Update: After publication, Bluesky announced on Aug. 18 that users set a “record high” for traffic on its service."
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/bad-ctos-mean-startups-have-millions-worth-of-cap-table-dead-weight/,TechCrunch,Bad CTOs mean startups have millions of dollars’ worth of cap table dead weight,"Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday. This week, I’ve been looking at the evolution of tech startups. The journey from two or three co-founders to an exit or an acquisition is long and arduous, and it turns out that a lot of VCs aren’t particularly picky about who sits in the CTO seat at company formation. That’s a bad idea. Some CTOs are extraordinary and able to build the first MVP version of a startup’s product pretty much single-handedly and then grow into an executive-level strategic leader. In many cases, however, that’s not what happens, and the CTO was basically the smartest person with a CS degree standing close to the CEO when the company was formed. The end result is that a lot of startups wind up giving a huge chunk of equity to someone who is essentially doing a job a semi-decent engineer could have done. If the company exits for a billion dollars, that means that short-sighted VCs who refuse to invest unless there’s a technical person on the founding team are effectively pushing startups into putting hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of equity in incompetent hands. It’s a phenomenon that happens surprisingly often, and it’s time that VCs get as savvy about the tech as they are about the market and financial side of company building. On that cheerful and highly opinionated note, let’s see what’s happening in the rest of startup land this week! Image Credits: Beata Zawrzel / NurPhoto / Getty Images I’m not gonna lie, I’m getting really bored of two billionaires bloviating about wanting to beat seven bells out of each other, MMA style. I’m going to say almost nothing about this, other than quoting Darrell’s article: “every time Musk does something asinine and moronic, we in the media wrestle with the anguish of whether or not we actually have to write about this stupid shit.” The answer continues to be yes, and we continue being distracted from other things that actually matter in the social media landscape. Such as: Creators gonna create: The “creator economy” is receiving its fair share of side-eye harrumphs, but it seems like VCs are still bullish on the market. Amanda spoke with seven VCs who believe the creator economy still has legs. (TC+) Tipping into the black: X’s CEO says the company is close to “break even,” and we’re waiting for the quarterly numbers to see how true that is. Even as she shares that, she argues that 99.99% of the traffic on the site is “healthy.” I dunno what she bases that on, but based purely on the amount of crap that gets flung into my eyeballs from Twi . . . I mean X . . . I’m going to take that particular claim with a dump truck of sodium chloride. Oxfords, not brogues: Reddit’s all-out war with its users continues apace. It seems that Reddit’s menswear hub, of all things, is the latest casualty in its battle with moderators, as Reddit admins replaced the entire moderation team with users who had little to no experience moderating fashion spaces. Grab the popcorn and watch the well-dressed drama, I guess. Image Credits: YinYang (opens in a new window) / Getty Images One of the best reads on TechCrunch this week was Alex’s article on the financial dynamics of SaaS companies. He breaks it down, explaining that there’s a worrying trend going down (TC+): A lot of SaaS companies are seeing their net dollar retention rates dropping. This is likely because corporates are tightening their belts and downgrading or canceling subscription plans to match their needs — or not upgrading as much as they used to. In a nutshell: Customers are not buying as much as they used to. The other side of that is startups straight up lying about their user counts. It’s usually the larger companies that get the most attention for “screwing up,” but younger startups are now increasingly getting caught in the act, too. In my opinion, in this case, “screwing up” is another phrase for “knowingly defrauding your investors,” and Rebecca argues that perhaps investors need to pay a tiny bit more attention to catch out their founders. Apropos rocky seas — we were ever so looking forward to the first Big Tech IPO in a while, but instead we get yet another SPAC, in the form of Better.com’s merger with Aurora Acquisition Corp. Better.com had originally begun making plans to go public via a $6 billion SPAC almost two and a half years ago. Later that year, the deal was valued at $7.7 billion. Things took a dramatic turn for the worse later that year, and the SPAC was delayed. And delayed. And delayed. It was put on life support again and again, with a bunch of absolutely savage rounds of layoffs along the way. Until, earlier this month, the SEC ended the investigation into the company’s SPAC, and now it looks like it’s finally happening sometime next week. All about that BaaS, no trouble: Banking-as-a-service, confusingly, can refer to three different parts of the industry, but in any case, all three seem to be evolving rapidly, as Christine explores in Fintech is a mess. Is BaaS the outlier? (TC+) We don’t work so well: One of the reasons that SaaS has been a darling for the VC industry for so long is that the business model is relatively predictable, you can measure almost everything, and it promises to upend industry after industry after industry. The opposite of that is, well, real estate. It seems that WeWork has gone from its $47 billion valuation to teetering on the brink of collapse, and Alex explains why in a great piece reminding founders that VC and low-margin business don’t mix. (TC+) Image Credits: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch Look, I know that cybersecurity rarely intersects with our startups category, but perhaps it should. Keeping half an eye on what the cybercriminals are up to might help keep their shenanigans front of mind. Data security is important, as we are reminded when millions of Americans had their health data stolen after MOVEit hackers targeted this little-known company called IBM. Apple hit the cybersecurity headlines this week, too, when Lorenzo looked into a $70 device that can pose as an Apple device, tricking you into sharing your password with it. Also, I was fascinated by the report of researchers watching hundreds of hackers trying to hack into computers that were set up exactly for that purpose — so-called honeypot computers. Of course, tech doesn’t just take a tumble for nefarious purposes; storms and other natural disasters can send our Wi-Fi networks to their knees. I thought it was super interesting to see that Comcast is wading into that space, too, with a new Wi-Fi extender that provides cellular and battery backup during storms. Super clever, and it might just save a life or two along the way, too. Petting moist glass: Smartphones are great, but most touch screens are god-awful if they get even a tiny bit wet. It seems like new tech will make that particular problem a thing of the past, at least for next-gen OnePlus phones. Ring, ring, who’s there? India is, by quite some considerable margin, one of the world’s largest smartwatch markets. Now, two of its biggest players — BoAt and Noise — are entering the smart ring market, too. Ring, ring . . . wait, didn’t I just make this joke?: Natasha reviews the Ring Air, from Indian electronics manufacturer Ultrahuman, concluding that it is ready to pick a fight with its biggest competitor: Oura. I’ve already touched on some of the top most popular stories of the week (can you guess which ones they are? Answers on Xweet).

Snap says it was just a glitch and that the AI didn’t briefly go self-aware. Sure, that’s what they would say.

2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/cruise-robotaxi-involved-in-a-crash-with-fire-truck-one-passenger-injured/,TechCrunch,"Cruise robotaxi involved in a crash with fire truck, one passenger injured","A Cruise robotaxi and an emergency vehicle crashed late Thursday night and left a passenger injured. The crash is the latest in a string of incidents that occurred this week after winning approval from the California Public Utilities Commission to expand commercial operations in San Francisco. Cruise posted a few details about the crash on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. Cruise said one of its self-driving Chevy Bolt EVs entered an intersection on a green traffic light at Polk and Turk streets when it was struck by an emergency vehicle that appeared to be en route to an emergency scene. A video posted by FriscoLive415 that includes police scanner information shows the airbags deployed in the vehicle and the passenger was complaining of a headache. A Cruise spokesperson said the company would provide an update as soon as it can. Cruise, self-driving vehicle subsidiary under GM, said there was one passenger in the car, who was “treated on scene and transported via ambulance for what we believe are non-severe injuries.” The company also added it would investigate to better understand the performance of its autonomous vehicles and will be in touch with the City of San Francisco about the event. The crash, which occurred around 10 p.m. Thursday, comes a day after San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu filed motions with the CPUC to pause the firms’ plans to charge for robotaxi rides in the city at all hours. Chiu’s arguments parallel comments made by residents and other city officials during a public hearing ahead of the CPUC’s vote. Despite opposition, the CPUC voted to approve Cruise and Waymo’s final permit that allows both companies to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, charge for all driverless rides and expand their fleets. In the past week however, Cruise has had a series of snafus, including at least 10 of its driverless cars reportedly stalling and blocking traffic, which threatens to derail its commercial plans."
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/spacexs-new-bandwagon-program-is-a-big-threat-to-small-launch-providers/,TechCrunch,SpaceX’s new Bandwagon program is a big threat to small launch providers,"SpaceX is expanding its rideshare program with a new series of missions aimed at meeting the demand for launches to mid-inclination orbits. The new program, which was quietly announced at a space industry conference earlier this month, is the latest sign that SpaceX intends to take no prisoners in the small launch market. Orbital inclination refers to what part of the Earth is visible to a satellite as it rotates around the planet. A satellite in an equatorial orbit is at 0 degrees inclination; a satellite in a sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) is slightly higher than 90 degrees; and a mid-inclination orbit is around 45 degrees. Currently, SpaceX offers rideshare services on the Falcon 9 rocket to SSO through the Transporter program, which is in notoriously high demand. But mid-inclination orbits (MIOs) are appealing to a growing number of customers, especially to remote sensing companies that want to strengthen their coverage over areas like parts of Asia and the Middle East. Right now, companies must often purchase a dedicated launch from Rocket Lab if they want to position a satellite in MIO. With the new rideshare program, called Bandwagon, SpaceX is going after this slice of the market. According to SpaceX’s website, it currently has two Bandwagon missions booked for 2024 and two for 2025. If they become even close to the popularity of the Rideshare program, they could be a major threat to all other small launch providers: According to Jarrod McLachlan, director of rideshare sales at SpaceX, who spoke at the industry conference, SpaceX has delivered 682 spacecraft to orbit to date via rideshare missions."
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/pentagon-urges-vigilant-against-foreign-intelligence/,TechCrunch,Pentagon urges US space companies to stay vigilant against foreign intelligence,"Investments, joint ventures or acquisitions could be vehicles for foreign adversaries to gain a foothold in the U.S. space industry, the Pentagon said in a new bulletin published today. The new guidance, “Safeguarding the U.S. Space Industry,” warns that foreign intelligence entities (FIEs) could use a range of strategies — including capital allocations — to exploit American space companies. Those attacks could be to harm a company, or to gain access to intellectual property for the benefit of a foreign national space program. FIEs “see US space-related innovation and assets as potential threats as well as valuable opportunities to acquire vital technologies and expertise,” the bulletin said. “FIEs use cyberattacks, strategic investment (including joint ventures and acquisitions), the targeting of key supply chain nodes, and other techniques to gain access to the US space industry.” The document, which was published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, provides some indicators that could suggest an FIE is targeting a business. These include offers to establish a joint venture with a company tied to a foreign government, or acquisition or investment from foreign companies via wholly owned subsidiaries registered in third countries. The Pentagon has made efforts in recent years in “cleaning up” the sources of capital that flow into U.S. space companies, including through venture capital. In 2021, the Department of Defense introduced a Trusted Capital program aimed at connecting companies with vetted sources of cash. The U.S. also uses established entities, like the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, to review some foreign transactions and investments in American companies and block these if they threaten national security. Such was the fate of Noosphere Venture Partners, the fund of Ukrainian investor Max Polyakov, which had a controlling interest in Firefly Aerospace. Polyakov eventually sold that stake to AE Industrial Partners."

Since then, an ice age has decimated the ranks of these majestic, delicate creatures. In 2021, “some months saw more than 60 unicorns being minted — more than two per day,” writes Alex Wilhelm. Today? “Only two new unicorns were minted in July, according to Crunchbase.” While we don’t have the data, it certainly feels like women-led firms are having a great year for fundraising. Image Credits: Getty Images Are women making real progress when it comes to raising VC funds, or is the overall slowdown in deal flow creating an optical illusion? In light of recent successes by firms like Supply Change Capital, Cake Ventures and Adverb Ventures, Rebecca Szkutak looked into whether these wins have kicked off a sustainable trend in venture fundraising. “It is probably standing out because there are only so many funds being raised and there aren’t 10 funds being closed every day,” said Kyle Stanford, a senior venture capital analyst at PitchBook. “But it doesn’t negate the fact that women are coming to the table from an investor standpoint.” Image Credits: Abscent84 / Gerry Images When an automobile factory lays off thousands, it can send economic ripples through a community for years as people retrain and relocate to seek new employment.

2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/ive-never-seen-so-many-crap-startups/,TechCrunch,I’ve never seen so many crap startups,"Startups are so full of shit right now.  The pipes are jammed and there are so many companies that are full to bursting with the desire to un-pack them.  We’ve just been through determining the shape of this year’s TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 200 and we are seeing a huge amount of waste recycling, poop and urine startups. Because SBF gets applicants that are often at bootstrap or pre-seed stages, we’re betting that this trend will show up on everyone else’s dance card next year.  One of the cool advantages of being a first-party witness to the thousands of companies that come through our application pipeline every year is that we see emergent trends bubbling up far sooner than most do. It’s a huge privilege to be able to see the future this way and one of the most exciting parts of our job. We featured generative AI companies five years before the popular investors took notice and climate tech 2.0 was in the Battlefield before it was in vogue. This year, it’s all about poop for some reason. We’re seeing input/output startups that want to rewrite the rules of recycling and purification with new tech. Founders focusing on gut health, optimizing the way our bodies process waste and what that can do to the brain. There are insanely stacked teams working on the future of urinalysis. There are companies using new tech that analyzes waste in the aggregate to help catch disease outbreaks in small populations and large. And yes, smart toilets — they will be a thing.  From toilet seats to sewer sensors, this arena is booming for a few reasons (breakthroughs in sample size, sensitivity and regulatory bottlenecks mostly). Blood, of course, remains a hot topic. Using less of it for faster testing is the great white whale.  Bodily excretions of all kinds are just all over our screens right now and it’s becoming clear that they’re the only way to really understand what’s happening in our bodies. It’s a big new data rush.   We’re seeing other wildly interesting trends too. Clean tech – Tied in with the biotech trend, we’re seeing a continued surge in input/output companies that process waste to produce byproducts like energy and potable water. These virtuous cycle companies are largely coming out of academia and are either licensing or minting patents. Carbon capture and removal is on the horizon. It’s deep tech but actionable. We may be so bold as to say it gives us…hope. Miltech – Once an arena just for contrarian VCs, miltech is booming and there is an appetite for the government sector to outsource R&D to the VC crowd. Drones, sensors, field medicine, space, weapon systems, analysis… you name it. More of the “centrist” crowd is beginning to field these companies in their portfolio. There’s an allegory here to the “wait, weed is legit” wave we saw a few years ago when firms started sliding it out of the “vice clause” column. Silver tech – Life expectancy is on the rise and the U.S. market is terrible at taking care of elderly and infirm people, in general. Technology that enables people to live longer on their own (not as big a factor in other countries where it is normal for multi-generational households to exist) and to take ownership of their health and care is on the rise. The robotics, AI and biotech sectors all play a part here. Social – The category is up in the air, again. After years of moribundity due to the major players being massively entrenched, there is an air of uncertainty as we watch Twitter collapse and many entrepreneurs are taking advantage of the vacuum to try new stuff. There will be interesting experiments and more self-aware takes on social. Fintech – Fintech is going deep over the next year building infrastructure in huge but un-addressed world economies rather than over-indexing on the western markets. Whatever holdover grip that foreign banking and social norms have on those systems is getting unraveled by startups that are creating new ways for populations in those markets to engage with finances. From investing to credit to compliance in local custom, these founders are seeing opportunity in their ability to be more specific and flexible. On the AI front, yeah there are a huge number of companies building what amounts to superlayers on top of the foundation of products like ChatGPT — but there’s also a wave of open source companies that are leveraging available models to make life interesting for the big players. But the big trend we’re seeing is that AI is actually everything. Instead of having a pocket of “AI companies,” we looked to the ways that every industry is using ML tools and modeling as an accelerant to their businesses. We’re seeing it speed up internal processes, customer acquisition, marketing and operations. It’s not a new category of companies, it’s a new layer that everyone has to consider mandatory. And yes, we saw that one coming too. But, for us, the big bet is in the bowels. ShitVC, now is your time. We’re announcing the Startup Battlefield 200 next week and a whole lot more at TechCrunch Disrupt, coming up on September 19-21st, 2023 — get your tickets now!"
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/musk-says-xs-block-feature-is-going-away/,TechCrunch,Musk says X’s ‘block’ feature is going away,"Part of the X (née Twitter) roadmap? Off-handed reply? Simple attempt to get a rise out of people? Time will tell. The one thing we can say for sure is that X’s owner responded to a post on the platform today foreshadowing the potential removal of the block feature. “Block is going to be deleted as a ‘feature’, except for DMs,” Elon Musk wrote. “Makes no sense.” The post was a response to a Tesla fan account who asked whether there was any reason to use block instead of mute. Regarded as a safety feature by many users, the suggestion that block could be going the way of the service’s old verification system was greeted with backlash from concerned users. “Twitter gives people a variety of tools to control their experience, including blocking,” the company writes on its help page. “Blocking helps people in restricting specific accounts from contacting them, seeing their Tweets, and following them. If you have been blocked by another account on Twitter, you can still block other accounts (including any that have blocked you).” While Mute may still remain, the features are not the same. Block restricts fellow users from interacting with, viewing and following an account. Mute simply hides your posts from their stream. Users are not made aware that they have been muted. Musk adds that the block feature will remain for direct messages. Blocking has become an increasingly essential feature for many users, as they’ve seen an uptick in spam replies on their timeline. Earlier backlash also found some users blocking X Blue/Twitter Premium accounts, as the feature began to prioritize their responses over non-paying users. Many public figures have also relied on the feature as a method of removing harassment from their feed. When — and whether — the feature is made obsolete remains to be seen. If Musk were to reverse course prior to implementation, it wouldn’t be the first time. A day after announcing plans to remove the service’s light-mode option, the executive reversed course, stating, “A lot of people have asked to keep light mode, so we will, but the default will be dark and dim will be deleted.”"
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/ai-could-save-the-day-for-software-companies/,TechCrunch,"As net retention plummets, AI could be the savior software companies need","New data shows that net retention at software companies has been halved in recent quarters, partially explaining the slowdown of revenue growth at tech firms. This isn’t wholly surprising, since net retention forms a core plank of the SaaS economic model and has been under extreme pressure, as we noted last week. This is because software companies are finding themselves trying to meet two seemingly contradictory asks: Tighten costs and stop letting growth slow too much while your existing customer base reins in spending. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. If you need a refresher: Net retention (aka, net dollar retention and net revenue retention) is a measure of how much existing software customers spend on your product over time. The metric is normalized to 100%, which indicates that a software company’s existing customers are spending no more and no less than they did before. Net retention metrics over 100% tell us that existing customers are spending more, while anything less than 100% signifies a fall in total spending. Enterprise software companies are expected to enjoy net retention comfortably above 100%. The higher this metric, the better, because if you can land customers that continue to spend more on your product over time, your company not only buys revenue with sales and marketing spend, but it also nets future growth. And since software revenue tends to be high margin by nature, that boost to revenue brings with it gobs of gross profit that can offset costs. In other words, declining net retention not only makes the SaaS economic model dicier than it was before, but it also means software companies will find it harder to lose less money and keep expanding at the same time. Now to the new data. According to Altimeter investor Jamin Ball, median net retention at public SaaS companies has followed the following curve in recent quarters: As we are more interested in how far above 100% these numbers are, this decline from 120% to 111% is not a difference of just 7.5%, but a shocking 45% fall over just two short quarters. It appears the trend we detailed last week was described accurately, and it was uglier than expected. Worse, as we are discussing median net retention rates, we can assume that at least half of all public software companies were under the 111% mark. We’ll get more data as companies continue to report their quarterly results, so expect the numbers to move a little, but this does not look good. Lower net retention, slowing growth and lots of SaaS companies are still in the red. Is software really just not that good a business? I think there’s more nuance to what’s happening here. You can get a subscription to Slack for as little as $7.25 per user, per month. Sure, that’s the cheap tier, but still it’s incredibly inexpensive. You can spend more — a stonking $12.50 per month — for the next tier up, or you can get an enterprise plan like my parent company Yahoo for more features, though I presume it’s possible to negotiate a volume discount at that point.

2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/amazon-offering-influencers-25-per-video-boost-shopping-feed-being-mocked-for-low-rate/,TechCrunch,Amazon tries to boost its TikTok-like shopping feed by asking influencers to submit videos — for $25 each,"Amazon is looking to boost its TikTok-style “Inspire” shopping feed and is offering to pay influencers $25 a video, but some creators are mocking the low rate. The company sent out an email to select influencers asking them to submit videos featuring two or more Amazon products in the same category. The company is offering $12,500 for a maximum of 500 videos, or $25 per qualifying video, according to a screenshot of the email shared online. The news was first reported by Bloomberg. Amazon plans to cap the initiative at 35,000 videos, which will cost the company $875,000, according to the screenshot. The company is looking for videos that “could be a product review of two or more products, a product comparison video, a ranking video listing the best products in a certain category, or even gift inspiration featuring multiple products,” the email reads. Some creators have reacted to Amazon’s offering and mocked the low payment on social media. “25$ per job lol Amazon can go find someone else to play that game,” said one creator in a post on X (formerly Twitter). One creator wrote: “500 videos !! Damn thats a full time JOB haha,” while another said “SOOOOO Up To $25 / video LOL no thanks.” Amazon did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. The online retail giant debuted the Inspire feed last December, introducing a new short-form video and photo feed that allows consumers to explore products and ideas and shop from content created by influencers, brands and other customers. The goal behind the launch was likely to draw consumers’ attention away from apps like TikTok, where brands can directly market to consumers, in order to drive sales on Amazon. In order to keep users engaged with the feed, Amazon needs to present a steady stream of new and interesting videos, which is why the company is looking to entice influencers with a cash offer. But, the rate that it’s offering is considerably lower than what influencers usually make per image or video. According to Brands Meet Creators, an industry consulting firm, influencers normally charge $212 for the type of content that Amazon is asking for. Of course, rates vary depending on the creator, so some make even more per post. Given these factors, it will likely be difficult for Amazon to court creators with a fraction of the money that they typically make. As noted by Bloomberg, the timing of Amazon’s initiative is not surprising, as TikTok has spent the past several months expanding its e-commerce offerings. The company began testing TikTok Shop in the U.S. last November, letting companies sell their goods directly on the app with a full checkout experience. TikTok is also said to be testing a new in-app “Trendy Beat” shopping section where it is offering products for sale that are shipped and sold by a subsidiary of its parent company, ByteDance. The new model sees TikTok operating an e-commerce model that is similar to how Amazon Basics and Shein promote and sell their own bestselling products. So, as TikTok looks to take on Amazon and Shein, Amazon is looking to build out and promote its TikTok-style Inspire feed."
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/suse-goes-private-again/,TechCrunch,SUSE goes private again,"SUSE, the German Linux vendor and acquirer of enterprise tools like Rancher and NeuVector, has had its fair share of owners since it was founded in 1992. There was Novell, which acquired it in 2003. Then Novell itself was acquired by The Attachmate Group in 2011. Then Attachmate and Micro Focus merged in 2014, only to sell off SUSE to private equity firm EQT Partners in 2018, which then took it public with an IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in the heady days of summer 2021. And now, EQT Partners is taking SUSE private once again. EQT remained SUSE’s largest shareholder throughout its time in the public markets, owning 79% of all shares. The firm is offering a 67% premium to SUSE shareholders over what the stock last traded at yesterday, but it will also allow existing shareholders to remain invested in the company in a private setting, too. EQT expects SUSE to delist in the last quarter of the year. We haven’t heard a lot from SUSE about this move, but the overall message seems to be that it’s business as usual for the company. “I believe in the strategic opportunity of taking the company private – it gives us the right setting to grow the business and deliver on our strategy with the new leadership team in place,” said Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen, CEO of SUSE, in a canned statement. “EQT Private Equity’s and SUSE’s partnership in a private setting has been fruitful before and we are excited about the long-term potential of the company and our continued collaboration.” SUSE has been in the news quite a bit this year. Not only did it hire away its new CEO Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen from Red Hat earlier this year and very recently named new chief financial and strategy officers, but the company also smartly jumped into a vacuum left by Red Hat’s decision to make it harder for third-party Linux distribution vendors to get access to the source code of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). In response to Red Hat’s decision, SUSE decided to fork RHEL and then partnered with a number of the affected vendors to launch the Open Enterprise Linux Association (OpenELA). SUSE says going private will allow it to “focus fully on its operational priorities and execution of its long-term strategy” — a focus that will surely include capitalizing on what the company clearly perceives is an opening to take away market share from Red Hat."
2023-08-18,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/how-to-cancel-disney-plus-and-avoid-the-price-hike/,TechCrunch,How to cancel Disney+ and avoid the price hike,"Many subscribers are fed up with Disney+ and its price hikes. The streaming service announced last week that it will increase the price of its ad-free plan on October 12, raising the tier by about 20% from $10.99 to $13.99 per month. The ad-free option cost $7.99/month a year ago; however, it went up after Disney+ launched its ad-supported plan. Unfortunately, this is a story we’ve heard again and again not only from Disney+ and its sister streaming service Hulu — which will be jumping from $14.99 to $17.99/month — but also rivals like Peacock, Max (formerly HBO Max) and Paramount, among others. Netflix recently axed its basic ad-free tier in the U.S., the U.K. and Canada. Another disheartening realization is that, starting in the fall, the average cable subscription ($83/month) will be $4 cheaper than paying for all the major U.S. streaming services ($87/month), according to the Financial Times. The data is notable since cord-cutters initially dropped their cable TV packages because streaming services’ prices were more affordable. Ah, those were the days, huh? If you’re a Disney+ customer looking to cancel your subscription, here’s how to do it. Note that if you subscribed to Disney+ through another provider, you’ll have to go to their website instead. For instance, Roku users can either go to the web app or use their Roku remote and select “Manage Your Subscription.” Meanwhile, Amazon users must navigate to “Account & Lists” and scroll down until they find “Membership And Subscriptions.” Even if you cancel your Disney+ subscription, your account will remain active in case you decide to renew it. Also, keep in mind that if you cancel between billing dates, you can still access content until the cancellation goes into effect during the next billing date."

The London-based Checkout.com, which was valued at $40 billion in January 2022, terminated the relationship earlier this month through a pair of letters, according to a report from Forbes. “We can confirm that as of this summer we no longer process payments for Binance,” a Checkout.com spokesperson told TechCrunch after publication. “This was our proactive decision on the basis of what we thought was best for Checkout.com.” The two letters, sent two days apart, cited “reports of regulators actions and orders in relevant jurisdictions” and “inquiries from partners,” the article said. It also added that Checkout had concerns over Binance’s issues it alleged the company has with anti-money laundering, sanctions and compliance controls. Binance’s spokesperson said it does not agree with “Checkout’s purported basis for termination and are considering our options for legal action.” Adding that it remains “committed to continuing to collaborate with regulators and partners around the world to ensure clarity and the best services and protections for our users.” The relationship ending also comes a few months after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed 13 charges against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao for allegations including lying to regulators about its operations and securities violations. Earlier this week, Binance announced it was shutting down its own crypto payments service, Bifinity, which it launched in March 2022. The buy-and-sell service shut on Wednesday. Separately, Binance also disabled its Binance Connect service on Tuesday to align with the exchange’s efforts “to focus on its core businesses,” according to a tweet by Biswap, a decentralized exchange on the BNB Smart Chain. Binance Connect’s original mission was to be the dedicated fiat-to-crypto on-ramp between Binance and other blockchain-based platforms. It provided support for a number of cryptocurrencies and traditional payment rails like Visa and Mastercard. This article has been updated to include a quote from Checkout.com’s spokesperson."

2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/twitch-will-let-streamers-block-banned-users-from-watching-streams/,TechCrunch,Twitch will let streamers block banned users from watching streams,"Twitch’s chat ban tools have been around for ages, but the platform is about to hand streamers a way to control who can watch a stream to begin with. In Twitch’s latest episode of Patch Notes, its monthly product update show, the company announced that it would soon let streamers block banned users from watching streams. If moderators or streamers enable the feature, banned users will be booted not only out of chat but out of a livestream itself in real time. When it rolls out within the next few weeks, the new anti-harassment feature will also become a built-in part of Twitch’s blocking tools, with blocked users automatically prevented from viewing a stream. When dealing with banned users, the feature won’t be enabled by default, but streamers will be able to toggle the option within moderation settings. In the Patch Notes stream, Twitch Senior Product Manager Trevor Fisher explained that the long-requested safety addition is a first step toward what could be a more robust solution down the road. “We’ve gotten a lot of feedback over the years, to be honest, that people want their channel bans to do more,” Fisher said. The new option will obviously have workarounds, as it only prevents logged-in blocked or banned users from watching a stream. Twitch will stop short of IP blocking for now and has no other obvious way of keeping tabs of logged-out users. The feature also won’t stop unwanted viewers from watching VODs, highlights and clips for now, though Twitch plans to add that capability in time. “This is something where we’ve kind of had to make a lot of incremental progress,” Fisher said.    "
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/healthxcapital-jungle-ventures/,TechCrunch,HealthXCapital’s team joins Jungle Ventures,"The team behind HealthXCapital, which invested in and helped health tech startups scale up, has joined Singapore-based Jungle Ventures. Seemant Jauhari, who led HealthXCapital since it was founded eight years ago, is now a partner at Jungle, where he will invest in healthcare startups in Southeast Asia and India. HealthXCapital’s portfolio includes RED.Health, Homage, Medfin and THB. The firm has fully deployed its first fund and will no longer make any further investments. At Jungle, Jauhari will take a similar approach as he did at HealthXCapital, combining capital with strategic partners in the healthcare sector to help startups toward validation and commercialization. These partners include providers, distributors and IT system integrators. Jauhari noted that about 30% of the global population live in India and Southeast Asia, but the regions are very underserved, with just 4% of the gross domestic product going toward healthcare. That’s where he sees an opportunity for digital healthcare and new business models to increase access to healthcare. Seemant Jauhari. Image Credits: Jungle Ventures As an example of how Jungle has worked with healthcare startups, Jauhari said one of its portfolio companies needed to expand from five to 12 cities. Securing supply from providers was crucial to meet demand, so Jungle’s board partners worked with the startup to create a time-bound group-level plan. Then, based on that plan, it used its strategic network to facilitate crucial partnerships across healthcare providers. Then an operational partner helped the startup run a unit economics optimization initiative that improved margins by almost 20% to 25%. Jauhari added that key trends emerging in Asian health tech include large-scale adoption of digital platforms in markets like India, Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam and specialty care growing by taking a “phygital” approach through a combination of brick-and-mortar locations and online platforms. In terms of valuations, Jauhari said it has not been a major concern for the healthcare sector because it has been underfunded, especially at venture growth stages. “Case in point, in the last five years, of the 2,000+ healthcare startups in India and Southeast Asia, less than 10% reached the venture growth stage and less than 20% of the total capital invested in the region has been invested in venture growth,” he said. “Hence, we see a clear opportunity to invest in an undercapitalized stage and region. Combining this with the resilience of the healthcare sector, we believe that sustainable and scalable businesses will drive steady valuations.”"
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/match-groups-background-check-partner-garbo-ends-its-partnership/,TechCrunch,Match Group’s background check provider Garbo ends its partnership,"Tech nonprofit Garbo announced today it’s ending its formal partnership with Match Group, the dating app giant behind Tinder, Plenty of Fish, Match and other apps. The two companies first teamed up in 2021, when Match made a seven-figure investment in the background check provider, following a series of reports about harm that came to dating app users through Match-owned apps. In particular, a damning investigative report by ProPublica and Columbia Journalism Investigations published in December 2019 prompted the company to begin to better focus on user safety, which also included a 2020 investment in Noonlight to help it power new safety features inside Tinder and other dating apps. In March 2022, Tinder rolled out access to background checks powered by Garbo through the app’s in-app safety center. The experience directed users to the Garbo website where they were able to fill in basic information about their match. The company said users typically only needed their match’s first name and a phone number to get started. Garbo’s unique quality, compared with other background check companies, is that it only focused on public records that contained reports of violence and abuse, including arrests, convictions, restraining orders, harassment and other violent crimes. It didn’t return any non-violent charges, like drug possession and general traffic tickets, excluding DUIs and vehicle manslaughter. After Tinder, Garbo rolled out to other Match dating apps in July, including Match and the single-parent dating app Stir. Despite its usefulness, there was some criticism that Match was passing the buck by offloading critical safety checks to a third-party partner which wasn’t deeply integrated into its apps, thus requiring daters to do more work. Others were skeptical about whether background checks were even helpful in terms of predicting the potential for abuse, as many abuse and domestic violence cases aren’t reported. Today, Garbo says it’s winding down its consumer background check service and also ending its relationship with Match. However, it will continue to honor credits users purchased (for a limited period of time). This includes users who claimed Garbo credits through partnerships with online platforms, including Roomi, HUD and Match Group apps (Tinder, Plenty of Fish, Stir and Match.com). These new and existing credits will be honored through August 31, 2023, Garbo says. For users who purchased credits directly from Garbo, credits are redeemable through August 31, 2023, or can be refunded through October 31, 2023. Garbo says the decision to wind down background checks will allow it to focus on “new technology and tools that directly empower individuals to protect themselves in the digital age.” Specifically, the company says it will instead work on a new guidebook to help people protect themselves online across every platform. There are hints of sour grapes in Garbo’s announcement, as it suggests that the Garbo app was meant to be an easier and more effective and affordable way to uncover histories of harm and violence, but “a lack of commitment from online platforms and the growing problems with public records has compromised the ability of users to harness the full power and potential of Garbo’s technology.” Garbo’s decision to pivot its business follows leadership changes at Match which saw Match Group CEO Shar Dubey stepping down in May 2022, with Bernard Kim taking over just as Garbo was meant to start rolling out to the company’s dating apps, which may have complicated matters. A Wall Street Journal report also indicates there were internal disagreements within Match Group about how Garbo tools should work, in addition to difficulties in getting online platforms to pay for its services. It also pegs the Match partnership investment at $1.5 million to get the background check service off the ground. At Tinder, the report says, execs wanted to add badges to profiles that were background-checked. Garbo disagreed, saying that underreporting of sexual violence means a simple badge doesn’t provide a full picture. Garbo also didn’t feel like Tinder fully promoted the tool to users. “Garbo is doubling down on our commitment to directly serving individuals over companies, along with more comprehensive engagement with public officials,” said Kathryn Kosmides, founder and CEO of Garbo, in a statement. “Over the next few months, Garbo is exploring a variety of innovations and opportunities to continue empowering people to protect themselves from bad actors. We will not stop advocating for survivors and working to protect those most vulnerable from violent and harmful behavior.” Match Group provided the following statement:  "
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/true-anomaly-gets-regulatory-greenlight-for-first-spacecraft-reconnaissance-mission/,TechCrunch,True Anomaly gets regulatory greenlight for first spacecraft reconnaissance mission,"Defense-focused space technology startup True Anomaly has received key permits from regulators that will allow it to demonstrate imaging and rendezvous capabilities on-orbit for the first time. The two authorizations — from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) — give the company the greenlight to perform non-Earth imaging and to demonstrate in-space rendezvous proximity operations, respectively. True Anomaly is planning on executing these capabilities using two of its “autonomous orbital vehicle” spacecraft, which the company calls Jackals, during a mission early next year. The 275-kilogram Jackal spacecraft will launch aboard SpaceX’s Transporter-10 rideshare mission, which is currently scheduled to launch no earlier than February 2024. True Anomaly had previously been targeting a ride on Transporter-9, which is launching in October, but CEO Even Rogers told TechCrunch that they decided to move to a slightly later launch date after experiencing some supply chain issues. “Sometimes there are pressures when you’re building new systems that you experience across the supply chain,” he said. “We were subjected to some of those delays and then it just got a little tight.” The startup also announced that it had opened its first factory, a 35,000-square-foot facility called “GravityWorks,” in Centennial, Colorado. The new facility will be able to produce a spacecraft every five days, thanks to a manufacturing approach that’s similar to how automobiles are assembled. “We’re not trying to commoditize spacecrafts,” he said. “There’s some phenomenal companies out there that are just trying to make spacecraft less expensive and fast, but we’re really focused on a national security space and securing the space domain from threats.” True Anomaly, founded by a quartet of ex-Space Force members last year, is looking to furnish the Pentagon with defensive technology, including an “autonomous orbital vehicle” the company calls Jackal, to protect American assets in space and conduct reconnaissance on adversary spacecraft. The company has found major traction for its tech, raising around $30 million in funding so far, including a $17 million Series A that closed earlier this year. In a previous interview with TechCrunch, True Anomaly CEO Even Rogers described an “information asymmetry” between the U.S. and its adversaries in space; the company wants to close that gap, by building spacecraft that can rendezvous with other orbital objects and capture images up close. The company is also planning to provide virtual training and using the Jackal on-orbit as a real-life training system for U.S. warfighters. Last month, True Anomaly debuted a digital and an “on-orbit range” service, which will be able to realistically replicate threats and allow users to train and test tactics. Eventually, Rogers said the company is looking to roll out more hardware lines and have “potentially hundreds” of spacecraft in every orbit, including cislunar orbit."

The new look also brings the compose button to the bottom left of the screen, which is where the compose button is located on X. The company says it made the change to make it as easy as possible for everyone to understand and explore what’s happening on Tumblr, whether they’re new to the platform or existing users. Image Credits: Tumblr “When adding something new to Tumblr in the past, we’d simply add a new icon to our navigation with little further explanation,” Tumblr wrote in a blog post. “Turns out no one likes to press a button when they don’t know what it does. So now, where there’s space, the navigation includes text labels. Since adding these, we’ve noticed more of you venturing to previously unexplored corners of Tumblr.” Tumblr says it has incorporated feedback from users during the testing phase and already introduced some tweaks for the new look. These changes include returning settings subpages (Account, Dashboard, etc.) to the right of the settings page instead of having them in an expandable item in the navigation on the left, fixing some issues with messaging windows on smaller screens, and streamlining the Account section to make it easier to get to your blogs. The platform is looking into making a collapsible version of this navigation and improving the use of screen space for users who have larger screens. The company says it’s also working on improving access to accounts and sideblogs. Tumblr saw an uptick in new users after Elon Musk took the reins of Twitter (Now X) last November, as users were looking for an alternative. At the time, Tumblr CEO Matt Mullenweg reported a 58% increase in iOS app downloads and a 57% increase for Android users in the first week of November. According to data that TechCrunch viewed from data.ai at the time, Tumblr gained 880,000 new installs across iOS and Android in November, up from 450,000 and 500,000 in September and October, respectively. But in the following months, its download numbers returned to standard levels (around 400,000 to 500,000 downloads per month). Since people are still looking for an alternative to Twitter, Tumblr may be looking to attract new users by making its platform look more like X. Obviously, many Tumblr users aren’t fond of the new change, and they have taken to X to express their displeasure with the change. The changes come a few weeks after Mullenweg revealed that Tumblr is spending about $30 million more than it makes each year. This isn’t too surprising, given Tumblr’s history. The company was founded in 2007 and acquired by TechCrunch parent company Yahoo for $1 billion in 2013. But by 2019, WordPress.com parent Automattic bought Tumblr for just $3 million. Although Tumblr has a loyal base of users, the platform has struggled to grow its daily active users since its infamous porn ban. But, the users it does have are extremely protective of the site’s culture, so modifications, even somewhat small ones, can be seen as unwelcome changes."
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/cruise-and-waymo-see-a-surge-in-robotaxi-app-downloads/,TechCrunch,Cruise and Waymo see a surge in robotaxi app downloads,"Consumer interest in Cruise and Waymo’s competing robotaxi services surged following a vote last week by the California Public Utilities Commission that allowed the two companies to expand and charge for their driverless car operations in San Francisco. Estimates from app intelligence provider data.ai showed 15,400 downloads of the Waymo One app in the five days following the August 10 vote — up 67% from the 9,200 downloads in the week prior. The Cruise app was downloaded by first-time users 8,300 times — a 77% increase — over the same five-day time frame. Overall, the Cruise app has been downloaded a total of 146,000 times, according to data.ai. Waymo One has been downloaded about 513,000 times, according to data.ai estimates. The Waymo One app likely has a larger total number of downloads because the ride-hailing service has been operational in the greater Phoenix area for years now. Cruise has started to expand to other cities, including Phoenix, but its greatest concentration of self-driving cars and its primary commercial operations are in San Francisco. The app downloads are one measure of demand. It’s less clear how many active users Cruise and Waymo have and at what rate consumers are being taken off the respective waitlists and given access to the service. Waymo recently told TechCrunch that 100,000 app users are on the waitlist for the Waymo One service in the San Francisco area. Image Credits: Data.ai The jump in interest comes as Cruise and Waymo begin charging for driverless rides in San Francisco. The companies have had limited paid operations in the city for months now. The CPUC vote gave both companies the final permit needed to offer commercial robotaxi services across San Francisco 24 hours a day, seven days a week and with no limit on the number of robotaxis they can put on the roads. Cruise sent an email August 14, just days after the vote, informing users that it will begin charging for all driverless rides. The company noted that the fares are shared with the user upfront and promised there would not be surge pricing, a tactic used by the human driven ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft. “Paying to ride will help us grow, and expanded hours and upgrades to our service are coming soon,” the email read. Waymo issued a similar message within its app and via email, albeit with a few differences. The company said it intends to start charging for Waymo One rides in San Francisco on August 21. Like Cruise, users of Waymo One will also see fares up front. Waymo noted that the price is based on the most direct route and that fare will stay the same even if the car re-routes in an unexpected way. Waymo said prices may be higher during busier times such as nights and weekends. The company added that its wheelchair accessible vehicle (WAV) service in the city will remain free for now. As consumer interest in Cruise and Waymo has grown, so has the opposition. Public comments prior to the CPUC vote showed a public divided on having robotaxis milling around public roads. In the days since the vote, several incidents involving Cruise self-driving vehicles — including one event in which 10 vehicles stalled and blocked traffic — has raised the ire of city officials as well. San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu filed motions Wednesday with the CPUC to pause Cruise and Waymo’s plans to charge for robotaxi rides in the city at all hours."
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/jack-dorsey-quits-instagram-putting-the-first-name-handle-up-for-grabs/,TechCrunch,"@Jack (Dorsey) quits Instagram, putting the first-name handle up for grabs","The @jack handle on Instagram is back up for grabs. Today, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, now Block CEO, announced he has deleted his Instagram account — the one with the coveted first-name handle. Typically, handles like these sell for thousands of dollars on the secondary market, so if the handle becomes available again, someone might make a killing by snagging it. In a post on decentralized social media Nostr, Dorsey shared he deleted the account after years of non-use. “Don’t know why it took me so long,” he wrote. “I think I was in the first 10 accounts on the platform, and one of the first angel investors. [Instagram co-founder] Kevin [Systrom] was our intern at Odeo,” noted Dorsey in his post. (Odeo was the organization founded in 2005 by Noah Glass and Evan Williams, that later reformed as the Obvious Corporation which ended up becoming the birthplace of Twitter.) Image Credits: Screenshot from Damus Dorsey also shared that when Instagram was sold to Facebook (now Meta), he stopped using the app — a history that was documented in Sarah Frier’s book, “No Filter: The Inside Story of Instagram.” Dorsey and Systrom had been friends since working at Odeo together and, at one point, Twitter even tried to buy Instagram, but was rejected. When Dorsey later found out that Instagram was selling to Facebook — Twitter’s biggest rival at the time — for $1 billion, Dorsey stopped posting to the app, having been hurt Systrom didn’t tell him directly, the book claims. He hadn’t posted since April 9, 2012, the book noted — the morning he found out about Instagram’s sale. The photo documented an empty San Francisco bus. But that and other photos are lost to history, as instagaram.com/jack is a dead-end. The timing of the account deletion is, of course, interesting, given that Instagram is now competing in the same market as Twitter with its own microblogging app, Threads. Dorsey retained a stake in Twitter, now X, after Elon Musk’s acquisition — a fact Dorsey reminded another Nostr user of earlier this month, in response to a screenshot of Google Bard’s incorrect AI-generated output that had dubbed Dorsey a winner from the Twitter sale. That said, the former Twitter CEO has backed other social networks that compete with Twitter, so the account deletion is probably not sour grapes over Threads. For instance, Dorsey helped Twitter rival Bluesky get off the ground, having initially incubated the project while serving as Twitter’s CEO. Last year, Bluesky said it received $13 million in funding from Twitter to get started on R&D. (It has since raised additional seed funding.) Dorsey also backed another decentralized networking protocol Nostr by donating around $245,000 in bitcoin. He now regularly posts to Nostr, which is accessible through clients like the mobile app Damus, which has since returned to the App Store after this summer’s temporary ban over rules violations. The Twitter co-founder concluded today’s post by saying [it] “Will be interesting to see what happens with the @name…” We couldn’t agree more."

2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/moemates-ai-avatar-analyzes-your-whole-screen-with-spotty-but-curious-results/,TechCrunch,"Moemate’s AI avatar analyzes your whole screen, with spotty but intriguing results","As evidenced by the slow death of Cortana, it’s clear that the AI assistants of yesteryear aren’t meeting expectations. And so they’re being remade. Amazon is building a new large language model akin to OpenAI’s GPT-4 to power its Alexa voice assistant. Meanwhile, Google is reportedly planning to “supercharge” Google Assistant with AI that’s more like Bard, its algorithm-powered chatbot. The paradigm shift hasn’t been limited to the realm of Big Tech. Startups, too, are beginning to realize their own versions of more helpful, useful AI assistants. One of the more intriguing ones I’ve stumbled upon is Moemate, an assistant that runs on most any macOS, Windows and Linux machine. Taking the form of an anime-style avatar, Moemate — powered by a combo of models including GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude — aims to supply and vocalize the best answer to any question a user asks of it. (“Moe” is a Japanese word relating to cuteness, often in anime.) That’s not especially novel; ChatGPT does this already, as do Bard, Bing Chat and the countless other chatbots out there. But what sets Moemate apart, is its ability to go beyond text prompts and look directly what’s happening on a PC’s screen. Sound like a privacy risk? You betcha. Webaverse, the company behind Moemate, claims it stores much of the assistant’s chat logs and preferences locally, on-device. But its privacy policy also reveals that it reserves the right to use the data it does collect, like PC specs and unique identifiers, in compliance with legal requests and investigating suspected illegal activities. Fundamentally, giving software like this access to everything you see and do is, even in the best-case scenario, a considerable risk. Nevertheless, curiosity spurred me to forge ahead and install Moemate, which is currently in open beta, on my work-supplied Mac notebook. For a free (for now), early access product, Moemate is impressively robust. Almost every aspect of the experience can be customized, from the avatars and their animations to Moemate’s synthetic voices and responses. There’s even a way to build custom character models and import them, plus export avatars in a format that other Moemate users can then import and use. Moemate’s “personality,” for lack of a better word, is driven by one of several text-generating models — users select which (e.g. GPT-4 versus Claude). As for the synthetic voices, Moemate offers the choice of ElevenLabs, Microsoft Azure or Moemate’s own text-to-speech engine. I opted for ElevenLabs’, which sounded the least robotic to me. Image Credits: Webaverse To “ground” the chosen text-generating model and attempt to prevent it from going off the rails (as some AI models are wont to do), Moemate gives each avatar a bio, which it feeds to the model at the very start of the conversation. Here’s one: Bios can be written from scratch and edited — a plus and a minus in my mind. I’m all for customizability, but I worry about the potential for prompt injection attacks, which try to bypass a model’s safety features, like filters for toxic replies, with cleverly worded text. One imagines someone writing a “malicious” bio, exporting it and sharing the ill-behaving avatar with unsuspecting Moemate users. In a nod to one of the intended demographics, Moemate offers an array of Twitch-focused features — none of which I was able to test, unfortunately. It can bring your chat window into focus and show the number of subscribers to your channel. And Webaverse advertises Moemate as being able to “talk and keep users engaged” if there aren’t any chat messages or “tackle stream chat by replying to chat messages,” although I question just how well it can handle those tasks. Stick to asking Moemate basic questions, and the experience won’t blow you away. In terms of its top-level capabilities, Moemate is beholden to whichever text-generating model you’ve selected. (Tellingly, Claude often identifies itself as Claude in addition to the name mentioned in the avatar bio.) It can generate images using the open source Stable Diffusion model, either when instructed or on its own, depending on the prompt. But with the abundance of image-generating services on the market, that feels like old hat. Image Credits: Webaverse Screen capture is a game-changer, however. Webaverse explains it thusly: No matter the text-generating model selected, Moemate can answer questions about whichever windows on the screen are in focus — whether a browser tab, settings window or video game. It’s unclear exactly how the app’s accomplishing this — not every model can accept images as input — but Moemate appears to be extracting the text from each screen capture and feeding that to the model. It’s an imperfect system. But I’ve successfully used Moemate to summarize recipes and webpages without having to copy and paste the text, as well as get the gist — or at least a high-level summary — of a complicated topic. Once, with Claude selected as the text-generating model, I asked Moemate a question about the macOS System Settings dashboard, which happened to be open on my laptop. It gave me a detailed rundown of each settings tab (e.g. Wi-Fi, Control Center) and their significance, plus additional context about the tab I had open at that moment (Privacy & Security). New information? Not exactly. But to someone who, for example, doesn’t know their way around macOS or isn’t incredibly familiar with the ins and outs of newer config options, I’d argue it’s genuinely actionable background. In another instance, with GPT-4 as the base model, I asked Moemate to tell me what it “saw” on my supremely messy desktop — a disorganized array of work and personal apps across two dozen Chrome tabs. The avatar fixated on the Google Messages web app, which I use to text — informing me that I seem to frequently text three specific people, all of whom it referred to by name. And for gaming, Moemate seems like it could save a Google Search or two. In a demo video posted by Webaverse, the app’s shown giving suggestions for which Dota 2 character to choose — and then choosing which weapons to select for that character. But as insightful as Moemate can be, it often breaks down.  Exactly where the app decides to focus its attention can be difficult to predict. Clicking a window into focus doesn’t always have the intended effect; Moemate will inexplicably refer to another window in the background sometimes, or fail to see a window’s contents altogether. Moemate also tends to veer off topic in bizarre ways. After giving me the rundown of System Settings, the assistant strongly implied that privacy was too “stressful” of a topic and suggested that I get some fresh air, instead — accompanied by it. When I asked how it might join me without a physical body, Moemate promised to take me on a “mental nature walk,” and proceeded to describe in great detail a stroll by an imaginary forested pond. Some of Moemate’s built-in commands are wonky also. The app can adjust the volume of voices, for example, but only its volume — not the system-wide volume. It can search the web for up-to-date answers to questions, too, but frustratingly not for every question. I only got web searching to work for the weather and trivia like “Who’s the current president of the U.S.?”; other times, Moemate performed a web search but failed to actually show the results. To be fair, it’s an experimental product in beta. But Webaverse says it’s already working on adding automation capabilities via browser and terminal integrations, like the ability to organize spreadsheets and even send emails — a mildly terrifying prospect, frankly. Despite its brokenness, there’s something compelling about Moemate. Multimodality, or combining text, image and other media analysis, is clearly powerful stuff, particularly in the context of an assistant running on a PC. I’m curious to see whether next-gen assistants, like the Windows Copilot, will follow in Moemate’s footsteps eventually, combining screen understanding with a text-generating model to supercharge productivity — or at least save a few steps in a workflow. Time will tell. But Moemate feels like a glimpse — albeit a quite buggy one — into the future."
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/fintech-investors-q2-2023-down-rounds/,TechCrunch,"6 fintech investors sound off on AI, down rounds and what’s ahead","At the height of the funding boom in 2021, no single sector enjoyed as much VC money as fintech startups did. But in 2023, it appears that fintech companies have to work harder to get funding. Global funding in the space hit a six-year low in the second quarter, according to CB Insights. Specifically, following a spike in funding in the first quarter driven by Stripe’s outlier $6.5 billion round, global fintech funding declined 48% to $7.8 billion in Q2 2023. Valuations have also taken a hit. With only a few exceptions, once-valuable fintech firms have seen their valuations drop significantly, based on secondary share activity as analyzed by Notice.co, which offers a pricing tool for the private markets. We’re widening our lens, looking for more investors to participate in TechCrunch+ surveys, where we poll top professionals about challenges in their industry. If you’re an investor and would like to participate in future surveys, fill out this form. As such, it’s no surprise that artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic of conversation in the space, as companies work to incorporate it into their offerings — some more meaningfully than others — in an attempt to stand out. “We’ve seen many of our portfolio companies adopt AI to increase efficiency, improve automation, and enable faster communication with their customers,” said Lizzie Guynn, a partner at TTV Capital. But Hans Tung, a managing partner at GGV, warned that just because AI is the hot sector of the moment, investors should not invest in it blindly. “AI is . . . overhyped. AI is central to the core business in some companies, and in others it is simply a supporting character,” he said. “We value domain knowledge and information on how to best apply technical solutions to solve customer pain points, be it consumers or enterprises.” Overall, navigating the venture landscape as a fintech startup in today’s market requires resilience, perseverance and a more responsible frame of thinking around growth. It’s clear that investors are taking more time to evaluate deals than they were during the funding boom. Aditi Maliwal, a partner at Upfront Ventures, explained how investors in the space are thinking: “We’re able to take a little bit more time to get to an investment decision, as processes aren’t happening in 24 hours like they did at some point in 2020!” To help TechCrunch+ readers understand what fintech investors are thinking these days, as well as what you should know before approaching them, we interviewed six active investors over the last couple of weeks. Plus, they were gracious enough to share some of the advice they’re giving to their portfolio companies. We spoke with: Everyone is talking about artificial intelligence. If a company isn’t already using it, they’re looking for ways to incorporate it into their operations. What is getting the thumbs-up and what’s not in the theme of the moment? What’s been surprising to me about AI in fintech is how much of it seems to be under the hood (automating rote internal tasks) rather than facing externally (flashy new features). This means that many of the most AI-forward companies may not be the most obvious ones. Over the years, we have seen many startups, especially neobanks, focusing on very niche segments of the population. What are your thoughts on such specific offerings? Is it a good strategy to be so specific and what do you need to do to be successful if so? The biggest evolution in consumer finance in the last decade has been for people to see their banks as extensions of their own personal brand, like their clothes, car or music. So, it’s a great strategy and we’ll be surprised by the depth and loyalty of these “niche” communities. Do you expect to see more down rounds in 2023? Are you seeing more companies raising extensions or down rounds compared to 2021 and 2022? More down rounds are coming. Supply and demand are still out of equilibrium, and I expect that will change as company balance sheets dwindle. What are you most excited about in the fintech space? What do you feel might be overhyped? Is anything hyped at this point in the cycle?! I think the fintech tourists are gone, and it takes real conviction in this market to build and invest. Banking today is harder than it should be, especially for the tens of millions of people who don’t have access to traditional financial services. How do you prefer to receive pitches? What’s the most important thing a founder should know before they get on a call with you? There’s often one chart or slide that defines a pitch. Cut the noise (and the 30-slide deck) and focus on the one thing that matters most to your story.  Everyone is talking about artificial intelligence. If a company isn’t already using it, they’re looking for ways to incorporate it into their operations. What are your thoughts on this? What is getting the thumbs-up and what’s not in the theme of the moment? Every company will adopt AI as another technology that enhances their existing offering. I don’t think of investing in AI companies as any different from people saying in the mid-2000s that they were investing in the internet or investing in mobile. AI is now a new paradigm that everyone is going to adopt. We know that most companies have already been using data to make decisions, so now they are going to be using open source models to help make faster and more efficient decisions. That said, a couple of categories are getting a lot of attention in and around the fintech ecosystem: Over the years, we have seen many startups, especially neobanks, focusing on very niche segments of the population. What are your thoughts on such specific offerings? Is it a good strategy to be so specific and what do you need to do to be successful if so? "
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/back-to-school-apps-2023/,TechCrunch,Back to school: The best apps for students,"Summer is coming to an end, which means students will (hopefully) be in air-conditioned classrooms and away from this unrelenting heat wave. It also means that they’re probably on the hunt for mobile apps that can help prepare them for the long school year. From math problem solvers and note-taking tools to book trackers and summary apps, we’ve compiled a list of our favorite educational and organizational apps for students to try this year. If you’re the type of student to wait until the last minute to read a book (we’ve all been there), then we recommend StoryShots, a free learning app that provides book summaries in text, audio and video formats. StoryShots breaks down a book into bite-size moments, giving the reader a few paragraphs that sum up the most important points. The app may be useful for students who want to learn about a certain topic in a timely manner, particularly for upcoming exams or a looming deadline. Plus, it’s handy for visual learners as the app provides infographics, mind maps, presentations and short videos. StoryShots offers over 400 books, in various genres like psychology, productivity, health & fitness, history, politics, marketing, spirituality & religion and more. Examples of best-selling books on the app include “A Promised Land” by Barack Obama, “A Brief History of Time” by Stephen Hawking and “Long Walk to Freedom” by Nelson Mandela, among others. StoryShots adds two to four books to its library every month. (Note that this isn’t a summarizing tool for textbooks — although it would be nice if it were.) Image Credits: StoryShots The app is free with ads; however, there’s also a paid version for $3.99 per month that gives users a number of premium features, including offline reading, full e-books and audiobooks and the ability to highlight and take notes, along with books in multiple languages. It’s available to download on iOS and Android devices. Image Credits: Essayist As the name suggests, Essayist helps students compose essays. The iOS app can automatically apply citation styles, including APA, MLA, Chicago/Turabian and Harvard. Essayist also assists with formatting in-text citations, references, page headers/footers and title pages, as well as page setup like font, font size, line spacing, alignment, page numbering and more. Essayist has a reference manager feature that allows students to include chapters from books, journals, magazines, websites and even movies. There are more than 25 reference types in total. Also, users can use Google Scholar to add references or copy and paste a URL. Essayist requires a subscription, which costs $4.99 per month or $29.99 per year. New users get a free trial. Image Credits: Photomath Photomath is a math-solving app that scans problems and displays a step-by-step solution to teach students how to solve difficult equations. Users point their camera at a math problem (either handwritten on paper or typed out) and the app sends the image to cloud servers to analyze and determine the answer. There’s also an in-app calculator if users want to enter the question manually. We found that Photomath was simple to use and produced results quickly. One drawback is that the free version only shows the first two or three steps. Users can unlock the rest of the answer with a subscription, Photomath Plus, which costs $9.99 per month or $69.99 annually. There’s a seven-day free trial. Additionally, Photomath Plus includes solutions from hundreds of textbooks so users can search for a question instead of scanning. There’s also a feature that helps students visualize each step with animated tutorials and provides voice-overs. We can see this being a helpful resource for students to check their homework and practice problems before submitting the material. However, it should be said that some students may use the app to “cheat” or use it as a shortcut instead of trying to solve the problem themselves. Users can download the app on the App Store and Google Play Store. Bookly is a tracking and management app that helps users stay on top of their reading goals. Users can set up how many books they want to read in a month/year and how much time they want to read per day. They can also establish an end date goal for each book, so students can more effectively keep up with deadlines and assignments. Readers add books to their library by either scanning the ISBN, searching online or adding the book manually (number of pages, title, author). There’s an in-app timer for users to tap when they’ve started reading for the day and a countdown based on their goals. For instance, if a user wants to read 20 minutes per day, Bookly will notify the user when the time is up. Users can also manually log a reading session if they forget to use the timer. Additionally, Bookly generates reading stats, such as total read time, number of pages read, reading speed, how many days a user reads in a row, reading streak and more. Bookly provides a PDF summary of all the data added for each book, so students can download reading reports and infographics to submit to their teachers. We can see this being a helpful app for educators to keep students accountable for weekly reading requirements. It can also be a great way to spark healthy competition among classmates. For example, whoever reads the most per class or school year gets a prize (or maybe just bragging rights). Image Credits: Bookly Other notable features include the ability to play ambient sounds while reading and a notes section to write down thoughts or record important quotes. Bookly also acts as a personal assistant by sending daily reminders to motivate the user to get their reading done for the day. While the app is free to download on iOS and Android devices, it also offers a paid version — Bookly Pro. The plan allows readers to add an unlimited number of books and provides access to more ambient sound options, among other features. The free version only lets users have up to 10 titles in their collection, but there’s also an option to delete books if they run out of space. Bookly Pro costs $4.99 for one month, $19.99 for six months and $39.99 for 12 months. Image Credits: Peech Peech is a text-to-speech reader that turns any text file, PDF, book or web article into audio. The concept of a text-to-speech generator alone is enough to make a multitasker happy. We can also see this being used by students who want to get some assigned reading done while commuting to school or walking to class. Peech could also be useful for people with dyslexia, low-vision or other conditions that make it difficult to read. There are multiple ways to listen to content, whether it be copying and pasting text directly into the app, uploading files, inserting a URL or even scanning a textbook with a phone camera. Notably, it’s available in 50 languages, so students can read material from their foreign language classes. In addition to the free version, Peech users can pay $4.99 a week to upload as many documents, PDFs or links to articles as they want. The app is only available on iOS devices. Image Credits: Evernote Evernote is a note-taking and task-management app that could be useful for students looking to stay organized all year long. Our favorite part about Evernote is that it provides various templates for different needs, such as class notes, essay outlines, to-do lists, reading lists, weekly planners and more. Users can organize their notes in virtual “notebooks,” which lets students easily categorize their documents based on the specific class or semester. Evernote also has a feature that allows users to embed photos, tables, audio, web content and more. Other features include being able to store emails on the dashboard, scanning documents, sketching on a scratch pad and setting up a calendar. Also, the app has integrations such as Google Drive, Slack, Outlook, MS Teams and Gmail, which is helpful for collaborating on group projects. Evernote is currently testing an AI feature, “AI Note Cleanup,” that can quickly sift through “scattered notes” and organize them into a more refined version that is easy to read. Evernote offers a free plan with basic features, as well as two premium tiers — Personal and Professional. The Personal plan is $7.99 a month and gives users more storage, a more customized home dashboard and more. The Professional plan costs $9.99 per month and offers up to 20GB monthly uploads. It’s available on the App Store and Google Play Store. Image Credits: Saturn Saturn is a calendar-based, social networking app for high schoolers. At this time, it’s only available on iOS devices. The free app is for students 13 years or older (9th through 12th grade) to share class schedules with classmates, organize club meetings/sports practice/parties, discover local events, chat with others and manage their calendars. Saturn says it’s working on launching experiences for non-high school users, as well. If a user enables notifications, they’ll get a reminder of what their schedule looks like for the next day. They also receive alerts throughout the day, reminding them of lunchtime, breaks and upcoming classes. Students can also get a personal countdown for each class period. To sign up for Saturn, students must input their high school to join the rest of their peers. Only students who go to that one school can view the profiles of others who also attend. However, the exclusivity may be frustrating to some if a specific school isn’t available on the app. There are currently 16,000 schools on Saturn. Overall, Saturn seems like it’s helpful for many students who want to manage their time better as well as stay connected with their friends and community. More educational apps for students to try:"
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/ford-aims-to-secure-battery-material-supply-with-new-canada-facility/,TechCrunch,Ford aims to secure battery material supply with new Canada facility,"Ford is partnering with South Korean battery manufacturers SK On and EcoPro BM to build a cathode manufacturing facility in Quebec, Canada. The CAD $1.2 billion (USD $890 million) joint investment will provide battery materials to supply future Ford electric vehicles. The onshoring of battery factories in the U.S. has boomed since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, which offers a range of tax credits for the production of clean energy. Ford, in partnership with SK On, has already pledged to spend close to $15 billion across three battery cell manufacturing facilities in the U.S. with an expected collective capacity of 164 gigawatt-hours annually. Now, the automaker is working to secure its supply of battery materials so that its vehicles can qualify for the IRA’s EV tax credit. The credit offers consumers $7,500 if the vehicle they buy meets certain battery sourcing and production guidelines. The IRA requires that 60% of the value of battery components be produced or assembled in North America in 2024 to qualify for half of the tax credit, $3,750. That percentage will increase to 100% starting in 2029. To get the remaining half, 50% of the value of critical materials must be sourced from the U.S. or a free trade agreement country in 2024 and 80% from 2027 to 2032. Other automakers are making moves to shore up battery material supply, as well. On Wednesday, General Motors announced an investment into battery materials startup Mitra Chem, which is developing iron-based cathode materials. In May, Tesla shared plans to build a lithium refinery plant in Texas. Construction on the Ford-SK-EcoPro facility has already begun, and production of the 3 million-square-foot factory is slated to begin in the first half of 2026. The site will have the capacity to produce up to 45,000 tons of cathode active material per year, according to Ford. The automaker estimates the new factory will produce 345 new jobs in Quebec. EcoPro will build the cathode active materials, specifically high-quality nickel cobalt manganese. The company will also work on R&D to increase battery safety, performance and productivity while decreasing the environmental footprint of the manufacturing process. Once the deal is closed, EcoPro’s Canadian counterpart, EcoPro CAM Canada, will oversee day-to-day operations of the facility. SK On and Ford will become investors. Ford isn’t the only one that will be using the cathode materials from the new Canadian facility. SK On’s U.S. subsidiary, SK Battery America, has invested $2.6 billion into two of its own manufacturing plants in Jackson County, Georgia. SK On is also partnering with Hyundai to build a plant, and collectively, the company expects its annual production capacity in the U.S. to reach more than 180 GWh after 2025. “Through the cathode [joint venture], the three companies can have a stable supply of battery raw materials in North America,” said SK On’s chief commercial officer Min-suk Sung in a statement."

On Wednesday, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu filed motions with the California Public Utilities Commission to pause the firms’ plans to charge for robotaxi rides in the city at all hours. The San Francisco Chronicle first reported the news. The arguments mirror many of the concerns brought to the CPUC by residents and city agencies; in a marathon hearing last Thursday, many residents insisted that robotaxis in their current form were too obstructive and unsafe to share roads with cyclists, human drivers and emergency responders. In the days since the CPUC’s green light, at least 10 driverless cars have reportedly stalled and blocked traffic, and one even drove right into wet concrete. City Attorney Chiu’s letter states, “San Francisco will suffer serious harms from this expansion of driverless AV operations that will outweigh any potential harms from a minimal delay in commercial deployment Cruise may experience.” The letter goes on to argue that the CPUC “failed to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act” when it green-lit the robotaxi expansions. In a comment sent to TechCrunch by email, a spokesperson from Waymo expressed support for the CPUC’s decision. They added,  “We will follow this development closely, and in the meantime, we will continue to work with the city of San Francisco in constructive ways while providing safe and accessible mobility to San Franciscans.” A Cruise spokesperson offered a similar statement in support of the CPUC. “It’s unfortunate to see the city use public resources to bypass that decision and restrict a technology with an excellent safety record used by tens of thousands of SF residents,” Cruise’s spokesperson added. Updated 12:38pm PT with a comment from Waymo and 3:40pm PT with a statement from Cruise."
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/what-is-a-liquid-neural-network-really/,TechCrunch,"What is a liquid neural network, really?","The initial research papers date back to 2018, but for most, the notion of liquid networks (or liquid neural networks) is a new one. It was “Liquid Time-constant Networks,” published at the tail end of 2020, that put the work on other researchers’ radar. In the intervening time, the paper’s authors have presented the work to a wider audience through a series of lectures. Ramin Hasani’s TEDx talk at MIT is one of the best examples. Hasani is the Principal AI and Machine Learning Scientist at the Vanguard Group and a Research Affiliate at CSAIL MIT, and served as the paper’s lead author. “These are neural networks that can stay adaptable, even after training,” Hasani says in the video, which appeared online in January. When you train these neural networks, they can still adapt themselves based on the incoming inputs that they receive.” The “liquid” bit is a reference to the flexibility/adaptability. That’s a big piece of this. Another big difference is size. “Everyone talks about scaling up their network,” Hasani notes. “We want to scale down, to have fewer but richer nodes.” MIT says, for example, that a team was able to drive a car through a combination of a perception module and liquid neural networks comprised of a mere 19 nodes, down from “noisier” networks that can, say, have 100,000. “A differential equation describes each node of that system,” the school explained last year. “With the closed-form solution, if you replace it inside this network, it would give you the exact behavior, as it’s a good approximation of the actual dynamics of the system. They can thus solve the problem with an even lower number of neurons, which means it would be faster and less computationally expensive.” The concept first crossed my radar by way of its potential applications in the robotics world. In fact, robotics make a small cameo in that paper when discussing potential real-world use. “Accordingly,” it notes, “a natural application domain would be the control of robots in continuous-time observation and action spaces where causal structures such as LTCs [Liquid Time-Constant Networks] can help improve reasoning.” Want the top robotics news in your inbox each week? Sign up for Actuator here. One of the benefits of these systems is that they can be run with less computing power. That means — potentially — using something as simple as a Raspberry Pi to execute complex reasoning, rather than offloading the task to external hardware via the cloud. It’s easy to see how this is an intriguing solution. Another potential benefit is the black box question. This refers to the fact that — for complex neural networks — researchers don’t entirely understand how the individual neurons combine to create their final output. One is reminded of that famous Arthur C. Clarke quote, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” This is an oversimplification, of course, but the point remains: Not all magic is good magic. The adage “garbage in, garbage out” comes into play here, as well. We all intuitively understand that bad data causes bad outputs. This is one of the places where biases become a factor, impacting the ultimate result. More transparency would play an important role in identifying causality. Opacity is a problem — particularly in those instances where inferred causality could be — quite literally — a matter of life or death. Paper co-author and head of MIT CSAIL, Daniela Rus, points me in the direction of a fatal Tesla crash in 2016, where the imaging system failed to distinguish an oncoming tractor trailer from the bright sky that backdropped it. Tesla wrote at the time: Hasani says the fluid systems are “more interpretable,” due, in part, to their smaller size. “Just changing the representation of a neuron,” he adds, “you can really explore some degrees of complexity you couldn’t explore otherwise. As for the downsides, these systems require “time series” data, unlike other neural networks. That is to say that they don’t currently extract the information they need from static images, instead requiring a dataset that involves sequential data like video. “The real world is all about sequences,” says Hasani. “Even our perception — you’re not perceiving images, you’re perceiving sequences of images,” he says. “So, time series data actually create our reality.” I sat down with Rus to discuss the nature of these networks, and help my creative writing-major brain understand about what the emerging technology could mean for robotics, moving forward. Image Credits: MIT CSAIL TechCrunch: I get the sense that one of the motivating factors [in the creation of liquid neural networks] are hardware constraints with mobile robotic systems and their inability to run extremely complex computations and rely on these very complex neural networks. Daniela Rus: That is part of it, but most importantly, the reason we started thinking about liquid networks has to do with some of the limitations of today’s AI systems, which prevent them from being very effective for safety, critical systems and robotics. Most of the robotics applications are safety critical. I assume most of the people who have been working on neural networks would like to do more with less if that were an option. Yes, but it’s not just about doing more with less. There are several ways in which liquid networks can help robotic applications. From a computational point of view, the liquid networkers are much smaller. They are compact, and they can run on a Raspberry Pi and EDGE devices. They don’t need the cloud. They can run on the kinds of hardware platforms that we have in robotics. We get other benefits. They’re related to whether you can understand how the machine learning system makes decisions — or not. You can understand whether the decision is going to meet some safety constraints or not. With a huge machine learning model, it is actually impossible to know how that model makes decisions. The machine learning models that are based on deep networks are really huge and opaque. And unpredictable.  They are opaque and unpredictable. This presents a challenge, as users are unable to comprehend how decisions are made by these systems. This is really a problem if you want to know if your robot will move correctly — whether the robot will respond correctly to a perceptual input. The first fatal accident for Tesla was due to a machine learning imperfection. It was due to a perception error. The car was riding on the highway, there was a white truck that was crossing and the perceptual system believed that the white truck was a cloud. It was a mistake. It was not the kind of mistake that a human would make. It’s the kind of mistake that a machine would make. In safety critical systems, we cannot afford to have those kinds of mistakes. Having a more compact system, where we can show that the system doesn’t hallucinate, where we can show that the system is causal and where we can maybe extract a decision tree that presents in understandable human form how the system reaches a conclusion, is an advantage. These are properties that we have for liquid networks. Another thing we can do with liquid networks is we can take a model and wrap it in something we call “BarrierNet.” That means adding another layer to the machine learning engine that incorporates the constraints that you would have in a control barrier function formulation for control theoretic solutions for robots. What we get from BarrierNet is a guarantee that the system will be stable and fall within some bounds of safety. You’re talking about intentionally adding more constraints.  Yes, and they are the kind of constraints that we see in control theoretic, model predictive control solutions for robots. There is a body of work that is developing something called “control barrier functions.” It’s this idea that you have a function that forces the output of a system within a safe region. You could take a machine learning system, wrap it with BarrierNet, and that filters and ensures that the output will fall within the safety limits of the system. For example, BarrierNet can be used to make sure your robot will not exert a force or a torque outside its range of capability. If you have a robot that aims to apply force that is bigger than what it can do, then the robot will break itself. There are examples of what we can do with BarrieNet and Liquid Networks. Liquid networks are excitig because they address issues that we have with some of today’s systems. They use less data and less training time. They’re smaller, and they use much less inference time. They are provably causal. They have action that is much more focused on the task than other machine learning approaches. They make decisions by somehow understanding aspects of the task, rather than the context of the task. For some applications, the context is very important, so having a solution that relies on context is important. But for many robotic applications, the context is not what matters. What matters is how you actually do the task. If you’ve seen my video, it shows how a deep network would keep a car on the road by looking at bushes and trees on the side of the road. Whereas the liquid networks have a different way of deciding what to do. In the context of driving, that means looking at the road’s horizon and the side of the road. This is, in some sense, a benefit, because it allows us to capture more about the task. It’s avoiding distraction. It’s avoiding being focused on every aspect of the environment.  Exactly. It’s much more focused. Do these systems require different kinds and amounts of training data than more traditional networks? In our experiments, we have trained all the systems using the same data, because we want to compare them with respect to performance after training them in the same way. There are ways to reduce the data that is needed to train a system, and we don’t know yet whether these data reduction techniques can be applied broadly — in other words, they can benefit all models. Or if they are particularly useful for a model that is formulated in the dynamical systems formulation that we have for liquid networks. I want to add that liquid neural networks require time series data. A liquid network solution does not work on datasets consisting of static data items. We cannot use ImageNet with liquid neural networks right now. We have some ideas, but as of now, one really needs an application with time series to use liquid networks. The methods for reducing the amount of information that we feed into our models are somehow related to this notion that there’s a lot of repetition. So not all the data items give you effective new information. There is data that brings and widens information diversity, and then there’s data that’s more of the same. For our solutions, we have found that if we can curate the datasets so that they have diversity and less repetition, then that is the fine way to move forward. Ramin [Hasani] gave a TEDx talk at MIT. One of the things he said, which makes a lot of sense on the face of it is, “bad data means bad performance.” Garbage in, garbage out. Is the risk of bad data heightened or mitigated when you’re dealing with a smaller number of neurons? I don’t think it’s any different for our model than any other model. We have fewer parameters. The computations in our models are more powerful. There’s task equivalence. If the network is more transparent, it’s easier to determine where the problems are cropping up.  Of course. And if the network is smaller, it’s easier from the point of view of a human. If the model is small and only has a few neurons, then you can visualize the performance. You can also automatically extract a decision tree for how the model makes decisions. When you talk about causal relationships, it sounds like one of the problems with these massive neural networks is that they can connect things almost arbitrarily. They’re not necessarily determining causal relationships in each case. They’re taking extra data and making connections that aren’t always there.  The fact is that we really don’t understand. What you say sounds right, intuitively, but no one actually understands how the huge models make decisions. In a convolutional solution to a perception problem, we think that we understand that the earlier layers essentially identify patterns at small scale, and the later layers identify patterns at higher levels of abstraction. If you look at a large language model and you ask, ‘how does it reach decisions?’ You will hear that we don’t really know. We want to understand. We want to study these large models in greater detail and right now this is difficult because the models are behind walls. Do you see generative AI itself having a major role in robotics and robotics learning, going forward? Yes, of course. Generative AI is extraordinarily powerful. It really put AI in everyone’s pockets. That’s extraordinary. We didn’t really have a technology like this before now. Language has become a kind of operating system, a programming language. You can specify what you want to do in natural language. You don’t need to be a rock-star computer scientist to synthesize a program. But you also have to take this with a grain of salt, because the results that are focused on code generation show that it’s mostly the boiler plate code that can be generated automatically by large language models. Still, you can have a co-pilot that can help you code, catch mistakes, basically the co-pilot helps programmers be more productive. So, how does it help in robotics? We have been looking at using generative AI to solve complex robotics problems that are difficult to solve with our existing methods […] With generative AI you can get much faster solutions and much more fluid and human-like solutions for control than we get with model predictive solutions. I think that’s very powerful. The robots of the future will move less mechanistically. They’ll be more fluid, more humanlike in their motions. We’ve also used generative AI for design. Here we need more than pattern generation for robots. The machines have to make sense in the context of physics and the physical world."
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/wonder-brands-e-commerce-series-a/,TechCrunch,Wonder Brands’ pivot to acquiring e-commerce infrastructure pays off,"Wonder Brands, an acquirer of e-commerce brands in Latin America, announced today the closing of $15.5 million in Series A funding. This enables the Mexico City–based company to expand into South America. Nazca and IDB Invest, the private sector arm of the Inter-American Development Bank Group, co-led the round and were joined by existing and new investors CoVenture, SilverCircle, Korify Capital, Infinitas Capital and GBM Mexico. The round will be extended for up to $20 million to give Wonder Brands around $40 million in total funding, Federico Malek, co-founder of Wonder Brands told TechCrunch via email. We profiled the company in 2021, about seven months after the company first launched to acquire digital brands in the MercadoLibre and Amazon ecosystem. At the time, Wonder Brands raised $20 million in venture capital. In 2021, the e-commerce roll-up, or aggregator, scene was in full force. Companies across the globe raked in large amounts of venture capital and grew quickly. Just in Latin America, for example, Merama reached unicorn status within a year of launch, while Quinio announced $20 million in initial funding to acquire some 30 companies. That gobbling up of e-commerce brands has slowed down, and there’s even been some consolidation within the aggregator sector. Few are seeing venture capital come their way in recent months, save for companies such as Una Brands and Razor, which may allude to how well Wonder Brands developed its business model. Speaking to that, Malek said in an email interview that organic brand development set the company apart from the traditional e-commerce aggregation model, which was one he likened to a private equity model with little operational involvement. “As a consequence, Wonder Brands stood out due to its strong brand development capabilities in the rapidly growing Latin American e-commerce market,” he said. However, it wasn’t always that way. When Malek and co-founders Nicolás Gonzalez Luna and Matias Casoy first started Wonder Brands, they told me their model was to clip the competition — which at the time was largely going after e-commerce brands in the $1 million revenue range — by focusing on larger sellers and operators bringing in at least $5 million in revenue. Malek explained that the model didn’t pan out, noting the company “found it challenging to identify successful digital brands in that range.” Wonder Brands then shifted its focus to acquiring e-commerce infrastructure, rather than existing brands, and developing its own digital brands. Wonder Brands uses data from online marketplaces to create products. It also deploys a customer-centric strategy driven by AI and technology to optimize operations, marketing, analytics, supply chains and working capital allocation. The company has since launched over 15 brands in the past 12 months and over 2,000 SKUs in the categories of home and garden, sports and fitness and beauty and personal care categories. The company plans to double the amount of SKUs in the next year and enter into new product categories. It also reached profitability in 2022. Malek attributes some of that growth to being in Mexico, calling it “one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the world,” where over 63 million people made online purchases last year alone, twice as many as five years ago. He also cited data from the Mexican Association of Online Sales that said last year, the total value of e-commerce sales in Mexico reached $31.4 billion, showing an annual growth rate of 23%. “While e-commerce sales in other geographies are stagnating, we continue to experience accelerated growth,” Malek said. “We’ve achieved remarkable results, generating over $100 million in annualized revenues with an annual growth rate exceeding 100%.” Wonder Brands is now operating in Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay with plans to use the new Series A capital to expand into the rest of South America. The company will also hire additional employees, develop new distribution channels and invest in go-to-market."
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/intels-modernization-strategy-could-face-setback-with-end-of-5-4b-tower-deal/,TechCrunch,Intel’s modernization strategy could face setback with end of $5.4B Tower deal,"In 2021, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced a comprehensive modernization strategy he dubbed IDM (integrated device manufacturing) 2.0. As part of that vision, the company announced a $20 billion investment to build two new Fabs (chip manufacturing facilities) in Arizona along with plans to increase capacity in other parts of the U.S. and Europe. In a 2022 article, we described Intel’s new approach this way: IDM 2.0 involves a three-pronged approach to semiconductor manufacturing: Intel’s network of global factories, use of third-party capacity and building out Intel Foundry Services, moves the company beyond simply producing Intel-branded chips, but helping meet the growing needs for custom chips. As part of that shift, Intel announced plans to acquire Tower Semiconductor, an Israeli chip manufacturer, for $5.4 billion in February 2022. That deal was killed yesterday when Intel announced it was walking away due to regulatory issues getting the deal approved, particularly in China. At the time of the Tower acquisition announcement, Patrick Moorhead, lead analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said that the deal would have given Intel access to custom silicon it didn’t have — but the pitched political battle between the U.S. and China doomed the deal, and it’s going to be hard for Intel to replace that capacity. “I am not shocked that China scuttled the Intel-Tower deal. The US and China have been in a tit-for-tat battle for the past 5 years on technology, and, unfortunately, both companies are in the crossfire. Intel now needs to determine how it will fulfill its end-to-end foundry vision,” Moorhead told TechCrunch. Unfortunately, that vision is going to take a big hit with the end of the Tower deal, says Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research. “Intel needs foundry capability, especially for 3nm future chips. They need to keep up with TSMC and others, and have fallen behind. Tower has great analog specialty chips that would have complemented Intel’s product line-up,” Wang said. That means that fab production is going to be key, and Intel will have to focus more on newer chips and foundry capacity, he said. Gartner analyst Raymond Paquet says that the failed deal is going to limit Intel’s modernization approach. “This is a setback for Intel and their foundry business. Tower would have provided Intel with more expertise and foundry customers,” he said. Acquiring these customers is going to be more difficult for Intel moving forward, and Intel will have to hire in-house expertise it would have gotten from Tower, Paquet said. Let’s not forget this is not the first time a big chip deal has been canceled because of regulatory scrutiny. In February 2022, Nvidia announced that it was walking away from the deal to acquire Arm for $40 billion. In 2021, we saw a flurry of chip company mergers, including that failed Nvidia deal, as well as several multibillion-dollar acquisitions that survived the regulatory process. That included AMD buying Xilinx for $35 billion, SK Hynix nabbing Intel’s memory unit for $9 billion, and Analog Devices acquiring Maxim for $21 billion. The ongoing political battles between China and the U.S., especially around semiconductors, could prevent those kinds of high-profile deals from happening again anytime soon. “Given the circumstances of this deal not being completed, semiconductor M&A will be more difficult for everyone [moving forward],” Paquet said."

In replies to users on X, Musk apologized for why the process is taking so long and explained what’s holding up X from providing this data to users. Shadowbanning has been a topic of concern even in Twitter’s earlier days, as users didn’t know they had been penalized in this way for their tweets. When enforced, users can post to the platform as usual, but would notice their tweets simply aren’t getting the traction and replies they normally would. The topic often became politicized, as Trump and other Republicans complained that Twitter was making their tweets invisible. After taking over Twitter, Musk even attempted to prove that shadowbanning was a common practice at the social network, by releasing information to the public, though ultimately what was shared was just a behind-the-curtain look at the complicated task of social media moderation. Still, Musk has insisted that users should have the right to know if they’ve been shadowbanned. At the Viva Tech conference, the Twitter owner said the company was working on a way to show users if their account was affected by the Twitter system in any way. In a new tweet this morning, Musk explained why the problem was hard to tackle, complaining there are “so many layers of ‘trust & safety’ software that it often takes the company hours to figure out who, how and why an account was suspended or shadowbanned.” He also said a ground-up rewrite was underway to simplify this codebase. The response didn’t shed as much light on the difficulties facing X’s latest project as many would hope, but a thread from Twitter’s former Head of Trust and Safety Yoel Roth provided far more insight. Posting on the decentralized Twitter rival Bluesky, Roth explained there was some legitimacy to Musk’s statements, despite the “word salad” he used. Roth began by explaining that social media sites would generally make note somewhere when they’ve banned someone and why. For smaller companies, this might even be a spreadsheet or Google Doc, at first. Over time, as the system and network scale, the company would generally move that info into some kind of metadata directly attached to user accounts. “Maybe it’s a free-text note on the account that says something like, ‘Yoel banned this user for posting death threats. Don’t unban them without, yknow, checking with me first, please,'” Roth said. Twitter, however, still stores “a lot of enforcement metadata in free-text notes attached to user accounts,” he noted. (This system is called Guano, because everything at Twitter had a cutesy bird name, he mentioned as an aside.) Twitter didn’t prioritize moving away from a free-text notes system because they were busy with other things, Roth said, but that led to problems because these sorts of notes are “very hard to parse programmatically — which is sort of what Musk is complaining about,” Roth said. “A human can understand and act on them, but if you wanted to provide automated user notice of account status, you need them in some structured format.” Roth agreed that rewriting the code that handles enforcement attribution is a good idea — and one that was in the works just ahead of Twitter’s acquisition, in fact. It was due to be shipped this year. (Perhaps, then, the Musk takeover of Twitter and the subsequent widespread layoffs were what slowed the project down?) “For things like spam, Twitter has hundreds (if not thousands) of different models and heuristics operating in parallel. That complexity is necessary to keep up with spam. But it makes it hard to explain exactly what caused a specific user to get “shadowbanned” (sigh…) at a specific moment,” Roth continued. “Anyway, if Twitter are rebuilding a bunch of the infrastructure that handles this, that seems like a good thing and I wish them luck,” he added, joking he left documents describing how to do it in his Google Drive at the company. "

For startups and smaller enterprises, this statement usually rings even truer. But it takes plenty of time and effort to recruit the right people. And, once on the team, making sure that your talent sticks around is an even bigger challenge. While some degree of staff turnover is natural, it takes time and energy for new hires to learn the specific ropes of your company, build relationships with colleagues and begin delivering results. If these new hires leave, it not only puts unnecessary strain on your operations but could also point to a larger issue. Retention initiatives often look at how competitive compensation rates are, or whether work-life balance at the company could be improved. Employee recognition is often left out of the conversation but it is something that has a significant impact on any retention strategy. That’s because 36% of employees cite a lack of workplace recognition as the main reason for quitting, with 60% being more motivated by recognition than money. And it’s not just retention rates that are at risk, but the performance of those employees who stick around. Research shows that employees on the receiving end of fair and consistent recognition from their leaders generated twice as many ideas per month as those who don’t receive the same close attention. In a tight labor market, every founder can benefit from taking a look at how the individual achievements of each team member are currently being celebrated and being honest about where there may be room for improvement. Here are four ways that founders can strategically improve employee recognition to better retain their best performers and boost motivation across their companies. Founders and senior executives are often overwhelmed by requests to act as speakers or mentors at industry events. At times, it may be appropriate to consider sending a rising star from the company in your place. This not only helps to increase company representation at such events but also offers a highly valuable way to recognize your top performers. For employees at an earlier stage in their career, getting named as a board advisor or mentor is an accolade that adds prestige to the individual’s résumé while also validating the presence of the company.

			It’s important to communicate exactly why a certain employee has been chosen to represent the company.

 For example, the former co-CEO of Salesforce, Bret Taylor, was also chairman of the board of Twitter in addition to his role at Salesforce, which helped draw attention back to Salesforce. Equally, speaker roles at industry events are highly valuable opportunities for aspiring leaders, helping them to fast-track their visibility among peers and forge valuable connections on behalf of themselves and the company. Rather than hoarding such opportunities, leaders who choose to share the benefits of their established networks with star employees for the greater good are set to win in the long run. Here it’s important to communicate exactly why a certain employee has been chosen to represent the company for such opportunities. In this way, other team members will know that it’s in relation to a specific achievement rather than a case of favoritism and gives others something to aspire to in the future. Many managers just aren’t good communicators and are often what could be called “emotionally stingy.” Although employees report a general lack of recognition, it usually does happen in some form. However, in my experience, smaller wins and general team achievements are limited to a shoutout during company meetings or buried within performance reviews. "
2023-08-17,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/bitcoin-spot-etf-crypto-demand/,TechCrunch,A bitcoin spot ETF could open the floodgates for wider crypto demand,"Years after it got initial approval, Jacobi Asset Management’s bitcoin spot exchange traded fund (ETF) went live this week, making the product the first of its kind in Europe. This is only the latest sign that Europe is making steady progress toward integrating crypto assets inside traditional financial instruments. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is dragging its feet by delaying deadlines for similar applications. That’s not to say there hasn’t been any progress stateside. According to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, bitcoin futures ETFs do exist in the United States, but they account for only about $1 billion in total assets under management (AUM), “So that does exist, but the spot is the holy grail. The spot bitcoin ETF [will be] major,” he said on TechCrunch’s Chain Reaction podcast.  The difference between a spot ETF and a futures ETF is that the former actually purchases and holds the underlying assets. It’s a more popular approach than futures-related ETFs. According to Balchunas, spot gold ETFs, for example, have consumed the majority of gold ETF activity, and bitcoin could be traded similarly if it gets regulatory approval.

			For an advisor, a bitcoin spot ETF wouldn’t be the main part of their portfolio; it would be like hot sauce — a small bit on top.							Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst, Bloomberg


 Lots of money is potentially up for grabs. “The stakes are high” for the various entities working to bring a spot bitcoin ETF to the American market, Balchunas argued. About 10 firms are competing to get the first bitcoin spot ETF approved in the U.S., and BlackRock, which has more than $9 trillion in assets under management, filed for its own offering in June. BlackRock also partnered with Coinbase in 2022 to provide its institutional clients with access to cryptocurrency, and later launched its own spot bitcoin private trust for U.S. institutional clients. “The question is, will [the SEC] approve [a bitcoin spot ETF], when will they approve it and how many they’ll approve at once,” Balchunas said. Right now, he and other Bloomberg analysts estimate 65% odds that the regulator will approve one or more by the end of the year. The odds are even higher for next year. “Everything is evolving towards that,” Balchunas added. “I don’t think it’s going to completely change the face of crypto. I think what it does is offer a portal for a big lump of money that largely would not probably deal with bitcoin, [but] might now. That would be the $30 trillion that financial advisors manage in America.” In other words, a bitcoin spot ETF could be considered the bridge that connects trillions of dollars to crypto. “Not everyone is going to cross that bridge, but you’ll certainly find some traffic there,” Balchunas said.

2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/review-acronym-rmt02-asus/,TechCrunch,"Acronym’s new computer with Asus is bonkers, but that’s the point","How do you critique functional art? Do you base your assessment on its capability or the resolution at which it solves a problem? Is it more important that it succeeds as art? Or is it the overall statement of purpose that matters, balance between form and function be damned? Not questions I expected to grapple with while reviewing a hybrid tablet, or, well, ever to be honest. But here we are. The design studio and clothing manufacturer Acronym has collaborated with Asus to produce another device in a co-branded line of computers. This one, the mouthfeel-rich ROG FLOW Z13-ACRNM RMT02 is the second of its “reality modeling tool” series. Asus has a history of eye-catching stunt machines, but the Acronym series (the last one was a straight laptop) is the most interesting to me, a student and collector of Acronym products. Image Credits: Matthew Panzarino Image Credits: Matthew Panzarino Acronym makes functional garments in layers out from skin to shell. The catalog is largely made from german fabrics and materials like schoeller-dryskin, Gore-Tex and encapsulated nylon. Since 1994, Acronym founders Errolson Hugh and Michaela Sachenbacher have built a truly unique brand over the decades — collaborating first with brands like Burton and then famously with Nike’s ACG sub-brand to create what the general public now thinks of as the modern technical sport aesthetic. The cut and shape of the clothes looks more akin to hiking or martial arts gear and the technical aspects are emphasized over anything else. Still, they’re stylish and unique — instantly recognizable.
 One of my oldest pieces is a first-generation J1A, one of the most iconic jackets in fashion design history. Twenty years after it was made, it’s still incredibly functional and feels 100% modern. That brand thinking is clearly written on the face, back and keys of the RMT02. It’s brutalist, functional gear that blends the modernity of the 16:10 display’s black monolith with a machined metal back and frame. Iconography and typography courtesy of designer David Rudnick wraps the case in many different applications — printed, milled and embossed. There’s a certain character that I absorbed from being, pretty much, present when personal computers came into the world. There is something about participating in that revolution, followed quickly by the internet while simultaneously drinking in books, movies and culture that was influenced by it. The feeling of computers as tools that you used to manipulate the bits and bauds of the internet, rather than as smoothly encapsulated portals that looked to disappear. The computers of my youth were messy bits of plastic and metal and wire and dust and blinking cursors on black and green screens. They asked so much of you — building your own PC was a DPS check for patience and hunger. Hunger for access to the world that could only be reached through that demanding door. Image Credits: Matthew Panzarino Though this ASUS tablet thing is light-years from that universe, I think it’s clear that Acronym feels some of that, too, and wanted to evoke it here. This makes some sense — Acronym’s clothing is designed to be an interface between the wearer and the world. Typically, wearing technical clothing and wearing regular clothing are really two separate experiences. Acronym has managed to blend the aesthetic and functional worlds so aggressively that it has managed to push a hernia bubble of its own into the universe where dressing for the apocalypse also keeps you dry, makes it easier for you to store and reach your stuff, and integrates with each garment layer you wear. Not easy. This machine lives in that same bubble. Image Credits: Matthew Panzarino I’m honestly not going to spend too much time on performance here. The battery life isn’t great but it’s a very capable machine that produces decent frame rates for gaming and will handle “internet stuff” just fine. It’s got a GeForce RTX 4070 laptop GPU and a 13th Gen Intel Core i9, and the display is really, really nice with a solid 165 Hz refresh rate. It has all of the other normal stuff a computer should have too. I remain massively unconvinced that you’re going to buy this if you’re not a collector or in search of an interchange of vibes with a computing device, so I’m not sure getting too detailed on performance is worth anything in the long run. I think the important thing to know is that if you go in search of one of these $2,500 hybrids, you’re not getting a hamstrung computer with it — it’s top tier for the form factor. The exoskeleton of the RMT02 features four clip attachment points where a somewhat complex sling can be deployed. The sling allows you to carry it over your shoulder sans bag — and yes, it integrates with Acronym’s Interops jacket system that lets you slide it under the tail of your Gore-Tex to protect it from the rain. It also clips in at four points to let you compute while standing up. It all works — really well, actually. I don’t know how many times you’d use something like that, or carry it outside of a bag, but it’s absolutely functional. Image Credits: Matthew Panzarino Wild, out there, kind of nuts, but ultimately functional. That’s the Acronym brand. The milled aluminum enclosure is gorgeous, the kickstand is solid as hell and the keyboard . . . is inscrutable. You’d better know how to touch type. The Cyrillic-ish alphabet designed for Acronym by Rudnick is all part of the theme — this is a computer from another dimension slightly off axis from yours, where people stand in the rain on the roof of a parking garage typing something into a terminal prompt. Of note, the package comes with a strapped pocket made of X-Pac laminate (an antislashing/tearing material derived from competition sailcloth) that would probably set you back several hundred dollars from Acronym’s website. Fun! The RMT02 is a tone-poem of a computer that sounds like a modem firing a handshake signal and feels like the turbo button of a PC tower. It wraps, clicks, straps, hangs and folds. It does stuff. Most computers work really well these days, all things considered. But most of them are pretty damn inert. They open and sit there. The RMT02 feels like it constantly wants to be other things, maybe things you need. I love that. It’s unique. It’s not for everyone."
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/armed-with-new-execs-dlocal-rebounds-from-a-short-seller-attack-in-a-big-way/,TechCrunch,"Armed with new execs, dLocal rebounds from a short seller attack in a big way","Uruguayan fintech company dLocal saw its stock surge by over 30% on Wednesday on the news that the payments outfit had tapped former Mercado Libre CFO Pedro Arnt as its new co-CEO. Shares closed up nearly 32% at $20.45, after climbing as high as $24.22 earlier in the day, giving the company a $6 billion valuation. That surge was on top of an August 15 spike after the company beat earnings estimates in releasing its second-quarter financials. Impressively, dLocal reported revenue of $161 million, up 59% year-over-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter. The company also saw a large jump in profits, reporting gross profit of $70.8 million in the second quarter of 2023, up 43% year-over-year compared to $49.6 million in the second quarter of 2022 and up 14% compared to $61.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Looking ahead, dLocal reaffirmed its guidance for the year of revenue between $620 million and $640 million and adjusted EBITDA between $200 million and $220 million. Founded in 2016, dLocal connects global enterprise merchants with “billions” of emerging market consumers in over 40 countries across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Hundreds of global merchants, including e-commerce retailers, SaaS companies, online travel providers and marketplaces use dLocal to accept local payment methods. They also use its platform to issue payments to their contractors, agents and sellers. Some of dLocal’s customers have included Amazon, Booking.com, Dropbox, GoDaddy, Mailchimp, Microsoft, Spotify, TripAdvisor, Uber and Zara. Earlier this summer, TechCrunch caught up with dLocal co-founder Sergio Fogel, who rejoined the company in June as co-president and chief strategy officer, per a Bloomberg report, “as part of a push to help regain investor confidence and stabilize the company’s stock after it tumbled following a probe in Argentina and a short seller attack.” Fogel was also among a group of shareholders who had purchased in the aggregate amount of about $160 million of the company’s Class A common shares in open market transactions — $100 million by General Atlantic and about $60 million by Fogel, dLocal co-founder Andres Bzurovski and dLocal chairman Eduardo Azar. Below is the result of the interview with Fogel, edited for clarity and brevity. TC: The last time I covered dLocal was in 2021. At the time, the company had raised $150 million at a $5 billion valuation. What has happened since then?  SF: A lot has happened. We went public at $21. The stock jumped immediately to $31 and continued upward till $60+. We crushed the numbers: TPV up 4x+, revenues up 3x+, adjusted EBITDA up 3x+. Then the stock declined with the overall market and was hit hard by a short seller report. You went public a couple of years ago — obviously before the market took a turn — and we haven’t seen a lot of companies go public since. Do you feel you all made the right decision at that time? Absolutely. For a payments company, reputation is key, especially for large merchants that we serve. Being a public company that is regulated in many markets gives our customers the confidence that their money is safe and that we comply with the strictest regulations. It has been a bumpy ride, but it was the right decision. You recently rejoined the company after having stepped away for some time. Why did you come back? I have been away, but I have never been far. Seba, our CEO, asked me for help, as managing a public company with 800 employees, a presence in 45 geographies and growing at a breakneck pace was taking a big toll on him, and he needed help. He could have hired someone, but we already share a high level of trust, and I know the business well. Of course, I could not say no, and honestly, I was missing the thrill. When I last covered dLocal, you all described yourselves as a cross-border payments company. How would you describe what dLocal does today besides handling payments across much of Latin America, as well as parts of Africa and Asia, correct? We expanded the scope a bit. We help the largest internet companies in the world move money in emerging markets. If a large company wants to accept cross-border payments, we’re there for them. If they want to pay their gig workers, we’ll help them. If they want to process payments locally, we will also help them. But we will never handle local payment processing for a local company — that market is well-served. We are uniquely positioned to serve a merchant in multiple geographies, with a high level of security and reliability, with just one agreement, one integration, one reporting platform — what we call “One dLocal.” It may sound trivial, but no other company offers one solution that covers so many different emerging markets. Our fastest growing geography is actually Africa. We are still growing in all geographies but Africa is the fastest growing and one that we are very excited about because it’s such an underserved market. What are you attributing the company’s recent revenue growth to? Being a public company, we can only comment on guidance in the earnings calls and other appropriate forums, so I cannot say anything beyond that. However, I can expand on our revenue growth drivers. Our first driver of growth is our sales team, who bring in more merchants. Merchants typically take some time to integrate and ramp up, so the growth that we see today is in large part attributed to merchants we signed last year. A second driver of growth is geography. Our existing customers normally start in one or two countries, and then they expand to more and more countries. But this is dynamic, because we also expand our geographic coverage in response to their plans. A third driver of growth is new products. For example, this year we launched an invoicing product that allows customers to accept payments without a technical integration. And the fourth driver is that our customers are growing fast in our markets. While growth in some developed markets may be stalling, emerging markets continue to grow very quickly. These are young populations, with a growing middle class, eager to spend. We are indexed to the growth of our merchants in these geographies. We are just scratching the surface. On a typical month, 40 million consumers pay through us. That may sound like a lot — until you realize we serve a market of 4 billion people, of which half are connected. We are serving just 1% of that population. Are you looking to expand geographically anymore? Outside of the regions you’re already serving? How many employees do you have? We will continue to expand geographically, albeit at a slower pace. But we will continue to be focused on the challenging markets; that is our DNA. We will not expand into the U.S. or Europe, as those markets are well-served and we have no value to add. We still have a lot to grow in the regions we are already in. There were allegations of fraud late last year that the company denied. What exactly happened? A short seller issued a report claiming that the company is a fraud and that we had used merchant funds to distribute dividends. Of course, before publishing the report, they took a short position, so they stood to profit from the price decline. The claims were absurd. The company is audited, and under a very high level of scrutiny. We run an external “Safeguarding of Customer Funds” review every year. Still, the audit committee decided to run an external investigation to provide all stakeholders — investors, customers, partners — reassurance about the business. The investigation found no basis for any of the claims. What’s ahead product-wise? Anything new? We are very focused on executing our plan. But, like everybody else, we are very excited by the possibilities that AI opens to all businesses and are exploring the area. Obviously the fintech world has had its ups and downs over the past couple of years. What are your thoughts overall on the payments space? There is a lot of hype around FedNow, but in my view, the really exciting developments in payments are happening in emerging markets. I would claim that Pix is the most successful initiative launched by any government in any field, anywhere in the world. Pix has taken Brazil by storm. You can pay anyone with Pix, from the largest department store to the smallest lemonade stand. Even beggars on the street take it. Every Latin American country is imitating it. Then you have UPI in India, e-wallets throughout Asia and mobile money, which is well established across Africa. And this innovation wave is not over. In Brazil, we’ll soon see Pix with installments, open receivables and the Digital Real. Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for The Interchange here."
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/bnpl-vendor-splitit-moves-to-go-private-in-exchange-for-fresh-funds/,TechCrunch,BNPL vendor Splitit moves to go private in exchange for fresh funds,"As the buy now, pay later (BNPL) market continues on its slow decline, one of the major players, Splitit, is embarking on an effort to reorganize and pivot. Splitit today announced that it has a $60 million “capital commitment” from strategic investors including Thorney Investment Group, Parea Capital and Motive Partners. Bringing the startup’s total raised to around $350 million (assuming the deal goes through), the proceeds will be put toward growth and “supporting the execution of its strategic plan,” according to managing director and CEO Nadan Sheth. “This new investment will enable us to strengthen our balance sheet, fuel our geographic expansion, strengthen our ability to attract large and sophisticated clients, invest in strategic partnerships and further develop our innovative white label Installments-as-a-service,” Sheth added in an email to TechCrunch. But while the capital promises to provide a much-needed infusion for Splitit, the commitment — or commitments, rather — have unusually stringent terms attached. Motive will supply $50 million ($0.20 per preferred share) in two tranches — $25 million each. For the first $25 million, Splitit will have to delist from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), where it went public in 2019, at the approval of its shareholders and re-incorporate as a private entity based in the Cayman Islands. Splitit, which is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, with satellite offices in London and Israel, is registered in Australia as a foreign corporation, which enabled it to list on ASX in the first place. Why the Cayman Islands? Presumably, because it’s historically acted as a haven for multinational corporations to shield some — or all — of their incomes from taxation. Unlike many countries, the Islands don’t impose corporate income taxes, capital gains, payroll taxes or other direct taxes on startups based there. For the second $25 million from Motive, Splitit will have to achieve certain undisclosed 2023 full-year financial performance milestones — milestones that Sheth says that the company is on track to exceed. Should shareholders vote to delist Splitit from ASX, they’ll be given the choice of retaining ownership in Splitit as a private company or trading their remaining shares on ASX prior to Spliti’s delisting. Sheth defended the move, arguing that Splitit has long been undervalued. “Delisting is critical because it gives us flexibility in terms of future capital needs and represents the best opportunity to create long-term value for Splitit’s existing shareholders,” he said. “It significantly strengthens our balance sheet and allows the team to focus on our white-label product strategy, innovation and our tier-one global distribution partners.” Thorney Investment Group and Parea Capital will supply $10 million of the $60 million in commitments in the form of a convertible note, a form of debt that can convert to equity at a future date. Founded in 2012, Splitit began as a traditional BNPL company focused on the consumer market. But in 2022, Splitit ditched its consumer business to launch a white-label installment payments platform for merchants. Sheth asserts the move paid off, pointing to increased revenues from 2022 to 2023. But given the company’s drastic transformation, it’s not clear that’s true. Splitit — like most of its BNPL competition, consumer-focused or no — suffered from a pullback in investment last year as macroeconomic conditions threatened the fundamental business model. Klarna, once Europe’s most valuable VC-backed company, suffered an 85% valuation cut from, while public companies like U.S.-based Affirm and Australia’s Zip saw their share prices plummet — over 77% and 89%, respectively, from January to July 2022."

The dirty little secret is that most or all of them involved a good bit of human hand holding. That can come in the form of manual remote guidance wherein a user remotely controls the process in real-time or a guided training, in which the robot is walked through the process once so it can mimic the activity exactly the next time. New research from ETH Zurich, however, points to a model that requires “minimal manual guidance.” It’s effectively a three-step process. First the user describes the scene and action. Second, the system plans a somewhat convoluted route. And third, it refines the route into a minimal viable path. Want the top robotics news in your inbox each week? Sign up for Actuator here. “Given high-level descriptions of the robot and object,” the research paper explains, “along with a task specification encoded through a sparse objective, our planner holistically discovers: how the robot should move, what forces it should exert, what limbs it should use, as well as when and where it should establish or break contact with the object.” The system is broken down into two main categories: object-centric and robot-centric. The former involves tasks like opening a door or a dishwasher, whereas the latter applies to things like moving the robot around objects. Image Credits: ETH Zurich The team says the system can be adapted for different form factors, but for the sake of simplicity, these demos are executed on a quadruped – specifically ANYbotics’ ANYmal. The startup was spun out of ETH Zurich and has therefore become a favorite for these sorts of research projects. The team adds that the work can serve as a stepping stone to “developing a fully autonomous loco-manipulation pipeline.” So, one step closer to systems that can open doors without any sort of human intervention."
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/ev-maker-vinfast-still-worth-more-than-ford-and-gm-after-stock-tanks-19/,TechCrunch,EV maker VinFast still worth more than Ford and GM after stock tanks 19%,"Vietnamese EV maker VinFast’s debut Tuesday on the Nasdaq public exchange was nothing short of remarkable. The automaker, which went public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Black Spade Acquisition, saw shares catapult 68% to close at $37.06 — giving it a valuation of $86 billion, a figure far above Ford, GM and Stellantis. But the real stunner came Wednesday. Even after VinFast’s stock price plummeted 18.75% and closed at $30.11, the company was still holding onto a market cap that put it well ahead of other established automakers. It’s an eyebrow-raising valuation for a young EV upstart that delivered just 11,300 vehicles in the first half of 2023. And its fundamentals show a company with costly ambitions that far outweigh revenue. VinFast wants to break into the U.S. marketplace on the retail and production fronts, a plan that includes building a $2 billion EV factory in North Carolina and opening up showrooms in California and other states. So what’s driving investor interest and volatility? The search for the next Tesla certainly plays a role. But there may be other reasons afoot. As the WSJ noted, 90% of the SPAC’s investors took their money out of the deal before it was completed. Fewer shares available for trading means lots of room for big swings in the share price. Share volatility is likely to continue for VinFast. But the real test will be in the years to come as VinFast attempts to scale production and sell Americans on its portfolio of EVs. That could be a rough road, considering that VinFast’s VF8 EV has been widely criticized for just about everything from ride quality to literally failing to operate."
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/a-growth-framework-for-reaching-1m-arr/,TechCrunch,A growth framework for reaching $1M ARR,"There are hundreds of guides on how to scale a startup, but many authors either haven’t done it themselves or are too forward-looking into the millions. So, how does a founder implement a growth framework to scale to the first million dollars in revenue? After working at hyper-growth companies such as Postmates and Coinbase, I wanted to try my hand at the accelerated growth of my own startup. I’ve been fortunate enough to have co-founded Virtualis, where I have led all marketing efforts as our CMO, from zero to $1 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) in our first year. I’m here to share the framework that I implemented, which I believe can apply to all startups just entering the market. I do not pretend to have a silver bullet, but I do have a tried-and-true framework you can use to help you achieve your first million. The core components to my early-stage startup growth framework are finding product market fit (PMF), identifying your ideal customer profiles (ICP), nailing down messaging, pushing users to their “aha moment” and finally optimizing for down-funnel metrics. Introducing my battle-tested startup framework: First Million Startup Growth Framework. First Million Startup Growth Framework. Image Credits: Jonathan Martinez If you’re either just starting out with your newly created startup or struggling to get to your first million in revenue, this is the early-stage framework for you. Let’s dive in! PMF is a term used to describe a product or service that has found enough organic demand from consumers. This demand is both sustainable and economically worthwhile for a startup to continue operating. So how can you find PMF in the most efficient and frictionless way possible? I believe that the answer to this question is through paid acquisition.

			There are 100s of guides on how to scale a startup, but many authors either haven’t done it themselves or are too forward-looking into the millions.

 With a paid acquisition channel like Meta or Google, you can launch a campaign to assess whether consumers are genuinely interested in your startup’s offering in an expeditious manner. It is important to understand that paid campaigns are not the most efficient on day one and take both experience and optimizing to drive costs down. However, it should be obvious if there is an interest with your startup based on the initial cost per leads (CPL). If you’ve spent $1,000 and have no purchases, or even signups for a waitlist, then the campaign may not be configured correctly or there’s an issue with PMF. Below are some rough gauges to determine PMF, outside of purely looking at metrics: "
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/nyc-tiktok-ban/,TechCrunch,New York City bans TikTok on government-issued devices,"New York City becomes the latest government to issue new rules banning TikTok, a measure meant to ward off potential security threats from China. The Verge reported the new ban, which is effective immediately and instructs agencies to delete the app from city-owned hardware within 30 days. NYC Cyber Command, which focuses on cyber threats for the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation, recommended the ban following a security review. The state of New York also issued its own ban against TikTok on government devices in 2020. Many other states have issued their own bans in recent years, including New Jersey, Ohio, Texas and Georgia. The U.S. House of Representatives banned the use of TikTok on government devices in December. Earlier this year, the Biden administration escalated its own pressure campaign against the app in an effort to force TikTok to part ways with its Chinese ownership. In March, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified before Congress, enduring five hours of questioning from lawmakers over concerns that China might leverage the app to compromise national security. TikTok is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, setting it apart from other major social media companies based in the U.S. “Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said in his opening statements. In May, Montana governor Greg Gianforte signed a law that bans TikTok in the state, effective starting in 2024. Unlike other state-level action, the ban is not limited to government-issued devices and would also limit normal users’ access to the popular app. TikTok pushed back with a lawsuit aiming to keep the app available to Montanans. This month, tech industry groups NetChoice and Chamber of Progress backed TikTok’s lawsuit to block the ban, arguing that “Montana’s effort to cut Montanans off from the global network of TikTok users ignores and undermines the structure, design, and purpose of the internet.” TikTok is also funding a separate lawsuit by creators who oppose the Montana ban, though the company wasn’t initially open about its involvement. The bans in the U.S. and elsewhere cite nonspecific security concerns over TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance. While there is no evidence to date that Beijing has leveraged the wildly popular social app for spying, that threat isn’t out of the question. China exerts great influence on private companies operating there. The government has been known to take a stake in private companies and shape their boards in order to influence decision making. And China has come out strongly against a potential forced sale of the company — an event that the Chinese government would be within its rights to block, given changes to export rules in late 2020. While TikTok has gone on a public relations charm offensive in the U.S. and made changes to the way it stores user data, the company is plagued by its own past mistakes. Last year, TikTok confirmed reporting that ByteDance employees tracked journalists’ IP addresses through the app in a scheme to crack down on internal leaks. Four ByteDance employees were fired, but the incident is a lingering black eye for a company eager to build trust with regulators abroad. Still, those missteps and TikTok’s Chinese ownership don’t amount to a smoking gun. China has plenty of other paths toward spying on Americans and could potentially obtain similar social media data, including deep banks of location information, from shady brokers that trade in app data. And whether it makes the TikTok threat look better or worse, Chinese hackers aren’t hurting for access — they apparently exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s cloud email service earlier this year to compromise a swath of U.S. government accounts."

2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/womens-sports-investment-deserves-the-same-consideration-tech-receives/,TechCrunch,Women’s sports investment deserves the same consideration tech receives,"While women’s sports leagues were collectively valued at $32 billion last year, they’re now $8 billion in the red. OK, that’s not true. But if it were, you’d question your investment. Those figures actually reflect crypto market examples — yet somehow, that volatile sector seems to receive faithful investment in a way women’s sports doesn’t. Examining recent tech history, we find similar controversy: more market crashes, liquidations and losses. Crypto traders suffered $320 million in losses in liquidations as the SEC lawsuit against Binance spurred a huge market plunge. The SEC is suing Coinbase for violating investor protection laws and for operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. Terraform CEO Do Kwon was arrested for allegedly manipulating the price of stablecoin TerraUSD — wiping out $60 billion in investor value. All these events occurred within one year. And if another sector experienced this sort of crisis — if the founders of the companies in which you invested were getting arrested for fraud — you’d rethink your investment approach. There’s an evolving future for crypto, and high-risk assets have their place, but when investors allocate funds, they should add safer assets in any portfolio. In my work, I see a reticence toward investing in women’s sports that reveals a disparity: The sector presents an obvious, stable growth solution. Women’s sports and cryptocurrency aren’t traded the same way. But any company’s or individual’s ability to consider high-risk investments must be balanced by stabilizing forces that provide steady growth. And women’s sports leagues, teams, and brands are continually increasing in monetary value. Amid volatility in some of business’ most high-profile sectors, facing ongoing economic uncertainty, investing in women’s sports this year is the most stabilizing investment one can make to create that balance. You just have to afford women’s sports the faith they’ve consistently, rightfully earned. The elements of women’s sports that make them a portfolio powerhouse are clearly demonstrated by the numbers. Women’s sports elevate the social/digital media world, which means you’d still be investing in the digital boom you adore. The women’s NCAA 2023 tournament generated 177 million impressions and $5 million+ in social value, and female athletes are garnering twice the social engagement compared to their male counterparts, despite having fewer followers on average. By comparison, Twitter/X traffic has trended downward since January, average daily active users decreased 9.8% in March, and monthly active users dipped 8% year-over-year.

			Good investing strategy seeks the next venture that will take off — the next market disruptor. Women’s sports is it.

 Refocus digital-focused investment around an institution where positive momentum grows. Consider collaborating or advertising with related outlets or collaborating with women’s leagues and teams to produce co-branded social media content. You’ll gain visibility among an increasingly engaged audience while empowering expanding platforms. Fans are getting more involved in women’s sports, and varied leagues have seen an increase in engagement versus 2022. WNBA App monthly active users grew 147% last year. Nebraska’s volleyball team sold out a football stadium, breaking a record of 82,000. And then there’s crypto. Trading volumes dropped in Q2 to yearly lows and average daily volumes for Q2 were down 44% versus Q1. Now recall the last time you went to a sports event. Much goes into making fan experiences memorable, but reconsider how to elevate the women’s sports experience. Which services or products can your brand or organization provide to make that better — more effective or fun? Women’s sports fans are more likely to remember, buy from, and engage brands that sponsor or collaborate with women’s sports leagues, teams, and athletes. When you invest in women’s sports fans, they will return the favor. Then there’s the simple investment strategy of moving toward where the money is actually flowing. The WNBA achieved double-digit growth for partnership revenue this year — an all-time 27-year high. The 2023 Women’s World Cup increased prize money to $152 million, 3x more than in 2018. Meanwhile, Elon Musk said Twitter/X advertising revenue has plunged roughly 50%. Because of standing inequities, I recognize hesitancy to invest in women’s sports, but leagues that afford to pay players more, increase prize money, and build state-of-the-art facilities generate undeniable revenue. Crypto is about trading currencies in digital spaces, but women’s sports provide cultural currency. Join a venture capital fund such as The Monarch Collective, and/or partner with other brands integrating into women’s sports — if you’re scared to do it alone. Investment in women’s sports leagues, teams, and athletes — from organizations, brands, communities and beyond — will advance equity within all sports. Viewership, attendance, revenue, and fan demand are all up. The time to invest is now. Brands that invested early show strong returns in a variety of ways: VISA saw a 27x increase in positive interactions with women’s sports fans via their USWNT partnership. DoorDash (22%), Nike, and Budweiser (11x) experienced similar return on investment (ROI). Good investing strategy seeks the next venture that will take off — the next market disruptor. Women’s sports is it. You can do good — and do good business at the same time.

2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/x-formerly-twitter-now-sorts-posts-like-count-profiles-when-signed-out/,TechCrunch,"X, formerly Twitter, now sorts posts by like count on profiles when signed out","X, formerly known as Twitter, now sorts posts by like counts as opposed to the order in which they were posted when users are logged out. Posts, formerly called tweets, still appear in chronological order on profiles when you’re logged into the social network, but once you log out, they are sorted by performance. The change was first spotted by 9to5Google. The platform is sorting posts based on likes, and not views, since posts that have more views but a lower like count are showing up lower in feeds. The change is definitely a strange one, especially since your most-liked posts could be from years ago. The new sorting method buries new and recent posts in favor of popular ones. Our tests show that even if you have a pinned post, it won’t appear at the top of your profile feed when logged out, which defeats the point of a pinned post. It’s unknown why X decided to make this change, but it’s possible that the company believes that if logged out users come across your most popular posts first, they may be more inclined to follow you or sign up for the service. X has made numerous changes ever since Elon Musk took the reins of the company last year. Earlier this morning, the social network made X Pro — which was previously known as TweetDeck — a subscriber-only product. The move doesn’t come as a surprise, as the company said in June that TweetDeck would soon only be accessible to verified users."
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/elon-musk-reportedly-donated-10-million-to-a-fertility-research-project/,TechCrunch,Elon Musk reportedly donated $10M to a fertility research project,"Elon Musk, CEO of the company formerly known as Twitter (now X), has reportedly donated to a fertility and population research project in Texas. According to Bloomberg, Musk, who’s been vocal about his belief that population collapse could end humanity, gave $10 million to the Population Wellbeing Initiative (PWI), a project housed at the University of Texas at Austin, through his charitable arm the Musk Foundation. Musk funded a two-day PWI conference last October, Bloomberg reports, but the organization didn’t initially disclose the 52-year-old billionaire’s involvement. A joint program between UT Austin’s Population Research Center and its economics department, the PWI’s website describes it as “a network of researchers” who conduct foundational work in economics, demography and social welfare evaluation. Specifically, the PWI investigates and explores issues around fertility, parenting and the future of population and economic growth, as well as infant and child welfare. Business Insider notes that a paper produced by the PWI and co-written by its director, Dean Spears, includes a projection that — based on declining fertility rates — “humanity is four-fifths over” and that, without a reversal, it’s possible “that humanity depopulates with cruelty.” Musk has fathered at least 10 children with three women, including the pop star Grimes and a top executive at Neuralink, a brain-implant company that he helped to co-found. His pronatalism, reportedly, was borne out a desire to prevent the demise of what Musk considers “advanced society” through the declining fertility of the intellectually gifted. Business Insider has reported previously that Musk believes that wealth is directly linked to IQ and has urged “all the rich men he knew” to have as many children as possible. “Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis,” Musk once tweeted in response to reporting around the Neuralink controversy. “A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far.”"
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/skich-discovery-app-for-mobile-games/,TechCrunch,"Skich, a discovery app for mobile games, now lets you launch and manage downloads","Skich, a Tinder-like game recommendation app where users swipe and discover mobile games based on their interests, rolled out a new feature that allows users to launch, collect, sort and delete games on their devices without leaving the app. Dubbed “Game Launcher,” the new feature collects games that users have downloaded on their phone and organizes them based on title, playtime, most recently played and when it was installed. This could be helpful for players who constantly install games and want to sort through the clutter in one place versus tirelessly scrolling on their home screen. There’s also a “Show Playtime” capability that tells users how many hours they’ve played, so they can see which ones they play the most and choose to delete the games they play the least. Plus, users can launch games through Skich so they don’t have to exit the app to play. Skich automatically adds games to Game Launcher if they’re in the database. One drawback is that only 15,000 games are available on Skich. If games are missing from Skich’s database, users have to manually input them. For context, there are an estimated 490,000 mobile games available in the Google Play Store and over 1 million games in the Apple App Store. The app is “actively replenishing this database every day,” Skich founder and CEO Sergey Budkovski told TechCrunch. Game Launcher is currently only available on Android devices. (Apple has rules about apps that could compete with its own App Store, as Skich might.) Image Credits: Skich In recent months, Skich has added new features like the ability to create game playlists or “Gamelists” and profiles for game developers. Skich also revamped its app last year with a new design, a new game selection algorithm and a section for pre-releases. The game playlists are a nice addition because they give users recommendations from like-minded players, which may be refreshing to those who only discover new games through editor picks on the app store. Skich hopes that adding the new game developer profiles will give them more brand awareness. “We know that the biggest problem for game developers right now is finding their audience,” Budkovski said. Because the mobile gaming market is so saturated, it’s hard for independent developers to make their mark. The company found that a lot of Skich users download more games from a game developer when they are going through their profile, similar to when someone discovers a new song and searches the artist’s discography. Image Credits: Skich Additionally, Skich plans to add a new capability to its Friends tab, which currently lets players follow their friends and other gamers. Users can see what games their friends added to their wishlist, played list, created a custom gamelist, and who left a review for a game. By the end of 2023, Skich will launch a real-time activity feature that shows which friends have started playing the game or are in the middle of playing, Budkovski told us."
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/it-shouldve-been-centaurs-all-along/,TechCrunch,"As unicorns grow rarer, maybe it’s time to look toward revenue, not valuations","Startups that were deemed worthy of a $1 billion valuation while still private were once so unusual, they seemed almost mythical — hence the “unicorn” moniker they were awarded. But when the COVID-19 pandemic started waning, venture capitalists started letting out all their pent-up energy, and capital and unicorns might as well have grown two horns, because they became as common as oxen. We’re unsure if this is good news or not, but new data from Crunchbase indicates that unicorns are once again a rare occurrence. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Only two new unicorns were minted in July, according to Crunchbase. That’s less than one every two weeks, and compared to the heady days of 2021, when some months saw more than 60 unicorns being minted — more than two per day — we’re now nearly close to zero. CB Insights data through June mirrors what Crunchbase reports, too. This trend isn’t new, though. We dug into this very point back in the second quarter, noting that billion-dollar valuations are now frequently impractical for startups given how software revenue has been devalued in recent years. But there is a difference between unicorns being minted slower than they were in 2021 and just two new unicorns in a month. What’s worse, there’s reason to expect we’ll see that number diminishing further. Back when Aileen Lee coined the term “unicorn” on TechCrunch back in 2013, the investor wrote that her team had uncovered 39 U.S.-based unicorns. At the time, given the bounds of her dataset (2003 to 2013), that worked out to four new unicorns per year and up to three “super-unicorns” every decade. That’s not a lot. Indeed, it makes July’s rate of two new unicorns a month seem quite high. So, how much has the natural pace of unicorn creation changed since Lee’s piece back in 2013? Let’s find out. "
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/snapchats-my-ai-goes-rogue-posts-to-stories-but-snap-confirms-it-was-just-a-glitch/,TechCrunch,"Snapchat’s My AI goes rogue, posts to Stories, but Snap confirms it was just a glitch","Snapchat’s My AI feature, an in-app AI chatbot launched earlier this year with its fair share of controversy, briefly appeared to have a mind of its own. On Tuesday, the AI posted its own Story to the app and then stopped responding to users’ messages, which some Snapchat users found disconcerting. “My Snapchat AI posted a random 1 second story and isn’t replying to me AND IM FREAKED OUT,” posted one user, @RyanJKrul on X (formerly Twitter). “i think I’ve seen this film before…and i didn’t like the ending,” wrote another user @repmiIas on X. “It went sentient,” joked @Zander0009. The Story My AI posted was just a two-toned image that some mistook to be a photo of their own ceiling, which added to the mystery. When users tried to chat with the bot, the AI in some cases replied to users by saying “Sorry, I encountered a technical issue.” Though the incident made for some great tweets (er, posts), we regret to inform you that My AI did not develop self-awareness and a desire to express itself through Snapchat Stories. Instead, the situation arose because of a technical outage, just as the bot explained. Snap confirmed the issue, which was quickly addressed last night, was just a glitch. (And My AI wasn’t snapping photos of your room, by the way.) “My AI experienced a temporary outage that’s now resolved,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. However, the incident does raise the question as to whether or not Snap was considering adding new functionality to My AI that would allow the AI chatbot to post to Stories. Currently, the AI bot sends text messages and can even Snap you back with images — weird as they may be. But does it do Stories? Not yet, apparently. “At this time, My AI does not have Stories feature,” a Snap spokesperson told us, leaving us to wonder if that may be something Snap has in the works. Snap’s My AI was a controversial new addition to the app, which initially resulted in users leaving one-star reviews on the App Store and calling for its removal, as the AI was pinned to the top of the Chat feed and couldn’t be removed or disabled. The AI also faced safety concerns, after tests found that it would respond in an inappropriate manner to minors’ messages, a report by The Washington Post found. Snap later added additional safeguards and parental controls. It’s been interesting to watch how young users have since reacted to the in-app AI chatbot, as some bullied My AI for kicks, while others remain convinced the addition is a little creepy — especially when it began to express itself through Stories, as if it had a mind of its own. But for the time being, My AI is now back to working normally, we understand — well, if you call these random generative AI Snaps “normal,” that is."
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/openai-acquires-ai-design-studio-global-illumination/,TechCrunch,OpenAI acquires AI design studio Global Illumination,"OpenAI, the AI company behind the viral AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT, has acquired Global Illumination, a New York–based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences. It’s OpenAI’s first public acquisition in its roughly seven-year history. The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. “We’re very excited for the impact they’ll have here at OpenAI,” OpenAI wrote in a brief post published to its official blog. “The entire team has joined OpenAI to work on our core products including ChatGPT.” Global Illumination, launched by Thomas Dimson, Taylor Gordon and Joey Flynn, has been involved in a range of projects since its founding in 2021. Backed by VC firms Paradigm, Benchmark and Slow, Global Illumination’s team designed and built products early on at Instagram and Facebook as well as YouTube, Google, Pixar and Riot Games. As director of engineering at Instagram, Dimson was instrumental in iterating the platform’s discovery algorithms. While there, he helped to start the teams responsible for Instagram’s Explore tab experience, feed and Stories ranking, IGTV and general data engineering. Global Illumination’s most recent creation is Biomes, a Minecraft-like open source sandbox multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) built for the web. The game’s fate is unclear, but one would presume that the team’s work at OpenAI will have less of an entertainment bent. OpenAI might’ve avoided acquisitions until now, but the company, backed by billions in venture capital from Microsoft and major VC players, has for several years run funds and grant programs to invest in emerging AI companies and organizations. Certainly, OpenAI is on the hunt for a commercial win. While ChatGPT achieved global fame, OpenAI reportedly spent upward of $540 million last year to develop it, including funds it used to poach talent from the likes of Google, according to The Information. OpenAI made $30 million in revenue last year. But CEO Sam Altman has reportedly told investors that the company intends to boost that figure to $200 million this year and $1 billion next year."
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/women-led-firms-fundraising-2023/,TechCrunch,Women-led firms are a bright spot in 2023’s fundraising slump,"Venture fundraising has been slowing down since the middle of last year. Larger firms are cutting their targets, and emerging managers are struggling to secure funds. But it isn’t all negative by any means. While some firms are struggling, others are seeing success — and a lot of the latter are funds run by women. Well, it seems that way at least. We can’t know for sure if women-led firms are actually doing better in 2023 than in past years — there isn’t fundraising data on exclusively women-led funds — but there have been multiple fundraising rounds worth paying attention to. Back in January, Monique Woodard closed a $17 million debut fund at Cake Ventures. Adverb Ventures, run by Slack product veteran April Underwood and Twitter alum Jessica Verrilli, closed on $75 million in July. Supply Change Capital, run by Noramay Cadena and Shayna Harris, raised $40 million last month, too. And that doesn’t cover all of it.  "
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/photo-layout-app-series-makes-it-easier-to-post-your-panos-to-threads/,TechCrunch,Photo layout app Series makes it easier to post your panos to Threads,"Series, an iOS photo app that helps you lay out your photos in creative ways for posting on social media, is now shaping up to become the must-have companion app for users posting their photos to Instagram Threads. On Threads, you can view images full screen, and with the right formatting, you can share full-screen seamless panoramas of your photos as well. This has already led some users to experiment with the new format, as artist Pete Halvorsen did, by experimenting with different aspect ratios and then splitting up photos so users could click on them in full-screen mode and swipe through. Image Credits: Pete Halvorsen on Threads (opens in a new window) This, in turn, prompted Series developer Ryan Carver to add new tools — specifically a tool called TH+ — to cater to the needs of Threads users to make this process easier. Carver has a background in photography and design, having previously led product development at photo-sharing app VSCO and having co-founded Typekit, which sold to Adobe, now Adobe Fonts. But for the past four years, he’s been working as an independent iOS developer, focused mostly on Series. The original inspiration for the app actually came from his own photography, curating and designing a gallery show in 2019, Carver told TechCrunch. Image Credits: Series “Out of that experience, I wanted two things: One, better tools to explore visual relationships between images, and two, to make it easier to share multiple images together,” he said. “The Instagram Carousel became the canvas for this; it’s such a great format for sharing multiple images in unique layouts,” he noted. He initially created Series as a tool that could design for the Instagram carousel and other social media, including TikTok. The app offers a variety of tools to mix photos and videos together, as well as other features like easy-to-use margin and edge controls, the ability to use layered photos or videos to create backgrounds, flexible layouts to tell stories using Diptychs and Triptychs, plus the option to post carousels and more. Image Credits: Series Carver says the best way to use Series is to add several photos and then explore the different layouts it offers to tell your visual story — like photo pairings, stacks, grids, and carousels. But after seeing how Threads supported full-screen panoramas, Carver added a new TH+ Frame Ratio to Series within days of Threads launching to the public, he says. The feature has since been discovered and used by Meta employees, including CTO Andrew Bosworth (@boztank), who posted an impressive Everest Pano that attracted over 7,000 likes and 180 replies.  Many users on Threads have since begun trying out the pano option by taking one image and then spreading it out across multiple panels for users to swipe through. Some also put the full image at the end of their carousel. To gain access to the TH+ Frame Ratio, Series users will have to upgrade to the Pro subscription. This $15 per year package comes with a bevy of other advanced tools as well, like the ability to import and lay out more than two photos or videos at a time; the ability to split content over more than three panels for Instagram’s Carousel or Threads; high-resolution export; the ability to export video up to 60 seconds long; the ability to preview Instagram Posts or Stories before exporting; custom templates so you can save and apply your favorite looks; power tools for complex layouts; and custom app icons. Image Credits: Series app screenshot Since launching version 1.0 in December 2019, Series has attracted around 5,000 monthly active users, and roughly half are paying subscribers. The app was updated to version 2.0 in December 2022 with support for video and more layout options, then more recently added the TH+ Frame Ratio with a July release aimed at Threads users. The app has since caught the attention of Instagram head Adam Mosseri, who responded to a request from Series on Threads asking if there was a dev-relations person for Threads the app maker could speak to. “Working on tighter integration like faster workflow, better preview, more layout options,” Series’ post teased. The app is a free download with in-app purchases on the App Store and supports both iPhone and iPad."
2023-08-16,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/this-70-device-can-spoof-an-apple-device-and-trick-you-into-sharing-your-password/,TechCrunch,This $70 device can spoof an Apple device and trick you into sharing your password,"Attendees at Def Con, one of the world’s largest hacking conferences, are used to weird shenanigans, such as a seemingly innocuous wall of computer screens that display people’s passwords sniffed over the conference Wi-Fi network. But at this year’s event, even conference veterans were confused and concerned when their iPhones started showing pop-up messages prompting them to connect their Apple ID or share a password with a nearby Apple TV. As it turned out, these alerts were part of a research project that had two goals. One was to remind people that to switch off Bluetooth on an iPhone, you have to dig into the Settings app and not just tap it off on the quick-access Control Center, which is displayed by swiping down from the top right corner of the iPhone. The other was “to have a laugh,” according to Jae Bochs, the security researcher who said they walked around the conference triggering these pop-ups with a custom-made device. “I had it in my bag throughout linecon [an informal term that refers to the time spent in line at a conference], vendor areas, and when I was walking around. I tried to remember to disconnect it if I was hanging out for a talk,” Bochs said. Bochs told TechCrunch that all they needed for this experiment was a contraption consisting of a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, two antennas, a Linux-compatible Bluetooth adapter, and a portable battery. Bochs estimated that this combination of hardware, excluding the battery, costs around $70 and has a range of 50 feet, or 15 meters.  They explained that Apple’s protocols for Bluetooth low energy, or BLE, allow the company devices to communicate with each other. Bochs said that they focused on “proximity actions,” which appear on an iPhone screen when Apple devices are close to each other. “Proximity is determined by BLE signal strength, and it seems most devices intentionally use lowered transmit power for these to keep the range short. I don’t :),” Bochs said. Bochs also said they created a proof-of-concept that “builds a custom advertisement packet that mimics what Apple TV etc. are constantly emitting at low power,” effectively spoofing an Apple device that tries to repeatedly connect to nearby devices and triggers the pop-ups. Unlike real Apple devices, his contraption wasn’t programmed to collect any data from nearby iPhones, even if the person tapped and accepted the prompts. But, in theory, they could have collected some data, according to Bochs. “If a user were to interact with the prompts, and if the other end was set up to respond convincingly, I think you could get the ‘victim’ to transfer a password,” Bochs said. “There’s an issue known for a few years where you can retrieve phone number, Apple ID email, and current Wi-Fi network from the packets.” The researcher said these issues are already known, at least since a 2019 academic paper that studied Apple’s Bluetooth low energy protocol and concluded that there are “several flaws” that “leak device and behavioral data to nearby listeners.” “Individually, each flaw leaks a small amount of information, but in aggregate they can be used to identify and track devices over long periods of time,” the researchers wrote in the paper. That’s why, Bochs said, they think Apple won’t do anything about this. “Most or all of this is certainly by design, so that watches and headphones keep working with Bluetooth toggled,” they said. Perhaps, they added, Apple could add a warning message when using the Control Panel toggles that alerts the user that tapping on its Bluetooth icon doesn’t completely shut off Bluetooth and their iPhone can still interact with proximity-activated beacons, such as Bochs’ contraption. By turning Bluetooth off in the settings, an iPhone user would be safe from devices like theirs, Bochs explained. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

The student discount is the most notable since fans — particularly DirecTV users — highly requested it since the service offered one when it had the rights to Sunday Ticket. YouTube didn’t share how much money students will save but told them to keep an eye out for updates. The regular Sunday Ticket plan currently costs $299 for the season; however, it will be $349 starting on September 19. Another “big piece of feedback” that YouTube is bringing to light is a flexible billing option, the company announced in a blog on Wednesday. YouTube said it’s rolling out monthly payment plans for viewers in most states except Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Nevada and Tennessee. (Subscribers in these seven states only have a single payment option.) The monthly payment plan allows users to pay for Sunday Ticket over time instead of all at once. The option is rolling out over the next week on both YouTube and YouTube TV. As for watching the games, YouTube is launching updates and new features to enhance the viewing experience. For instance, YouTube users can use live chat and polls to react in real time with other fans through their mobile and TV devices. Also, mobile users can watch highlights through NFL Shorts on YouTube and then jump to a live game by clicking on the red “Live” ring around the NFL channel avatar. Soon, the platform will launch NFL Shop integrations. Previously only available on YouTube TV, the Key Plays feature will finally be available on the main YouTube experience. However, it will only be available on TVs this season. The Emmy Award–winning feature lets Sunday Ticket subscribers catch up on a game by watching a quick video of each major play before jumping into the live game. YouTube also reminded users of its recently launched multiview feature, allowing viewers to choose from four-game, three-game and two-game viewing combinations. Subscribers also have access to an extensive assortment of games. For instance, they can watch a Sunday game and a local NFL game side by side or even NFL and college football games simultaneously. Users who sign up for the NFL Sunday Ticket + NFL RedZone package get to watch both out-of-market games and RedZone with multiview. As the platform gears up for its first year as the streaming home of NFL Sunday Ticket, there’s a lot of pressure to give fans a seamless experience.

It’s decidedly less thrilling when, just a few months later, the bottom of the fund’s target market doesn’t just drop, but also nearly disintegrates. How do you move forward? We’re excited to learn the answer to that and many more questions when Katie Haun, founder and CEO of Haun Ventures, joins us at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, which runs September 19–21 in San Francisco. Crypto VC firms raised more than $22 billion in 2022, compared with just $2 billion raised at this point in 2023. And yet — to paraphrase Monty Python — the crypto market is not dead yet. Last June, Haun Ventures led a $10 million seed round for Argus, a web3 gaming studio. The VC firm has led other investment rounds for Sovereign Labs, thirdweb, Euler, TaxBit, Highlight and Zora. How has the crypto market crisis impacted Haun’s strategy — both in the types of investments she makes and in the timeframe for deploying all that dry powder? Given the industry’s volatility, and Haun’s background as a federal prosecutor on a cryptocurrency task force, we’re also interested to hear her take on regulating the crypto industry. Don’t miss what’s sure to be a fascinating discussion about the current and future state of crypto and web3 investment. Katie Haun and her team raised a $500 million early-stage fund and a $1 billion acceleration fund to invest in the future of web3. Previously, Haun joined Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in 2018 as its 11th general partner — and its first female general partner — where she co-led the firm’s three crypto funds. Prior to a16z, Haun spent a decade as a federal prosecutor focusing on fraud and cyber and corporate crime alongside agencies such as the SEC, FBI and Treasury Department. She created the government’s first cryptocurrency task force and led investigations into the Mt. Gox hack and the corrupt agents on the Silk Road task force. While with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Haun prosecuted RICO murders, organized crime, public corruption, gangs and money laundering. She also held senior policy positions at DOJ headquarters in both the National Security Division and the Attorney General’s office, where her portfolio included antitrust, tax and national security. Since joining the private sector, Haun has testified before both the House and Senate on the intersection of technology and regulation. She has taught a course on crypto at Stanford Business School and on cybercrime at Stanford Law School. Haun clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and is an honors graduate of Stanford Law School. She is a lifetime member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and she currently serves on the board of Coinbase. TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 takes place on September 19–21 in San Francisco.

The social network updated its Blue/X Premium support page to include details about the highlights feature. “Feature your best posts by Highlighting those posts and they’ll appear on your profile in a dedicated tab,” the description of the feature said. Over the last few days, X has been rolling out the new ‘Highlights’ tab to some subscribers. But according to the updated support page, the company is now making the feature available to all paid users. The platform already offers users the way to pin one of their tweets to their profiles so that visitors first see it. However, it wasn’t possible to pack multiple tweets worth of information until now. The ‘Highlights’ tab could be useful for an artist to put a spotlight on their work or for an author to feature their popular articles. Subscribers can add any of their posts to the Highlights tab by tapping on the three-dot menu of the post and then selecting the “Add/remove from Highlights” option. Along with the new Highlights tab, the company also made TweetDeck a subscriber-only product in a move to get more people to pay for its premium service. The company has been trying multiple growth strategies such as giving subscribers a slice of ad revenue and showing community posts on the algorithmic “For You” timeline. In a more controversial move this week, X briefly slowed down the opening time for links to The New York Times, Threads and Bluesky. It wasn’t clear if it was a deliberate change or a bug, which cause the delay in opening links."
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/x-formerly-twitter-makes-x-pro-formerly-tweetdeck-a-subscriber-only-product/,TechCrunch,X (formerly Twitter) makes X Pro (formerly TweetDeck) a subscriber-only product,"Elon Musk–owned social network X, formerly Twitter, has made X Pro — which was previously known as TweetDeck — a subscriber-only product. Several users noted on the platform that while trying to access TweetDeck, they were shown a pop-up prompting them to buy a Blue subscription. The move isn’t entirely surprising, as on July 3, the company said that within 30 days TweetDeck would be accessible to only verified users. Like a lot of Musk promised timelines, the social network got delayed in implementing the new rule by a few days. Plenty of newsrooms, individual journalists, researchers and social media consultants used TweetDeck — which was acquired by Twitter in a $40 million deal in 2011 — to track multiple lists and trends on Twitter/X. They will now have to pay up to keep using the tool. For the past few years, TweetDeck felt like an ignored product. The previous management of the social network started testing a new version of the tool in 2021, but it wasn’t rolled out to a wider audience. In June 2022, the company shut down TweetDeck’s Mac client. Under Musk, X has tried to make its subscription attractive with many offerings. Apart from the verification mark, which you can hide now, it rolled out the ability to post longer texts and videos, had fewer ads, offered access to encryption in DMs and had ad revenue sharing."
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/electrify-america-backed-75mw-solar-farm-kicks-off-operations/,TechCrunch,Electrify America–backed 75MW solar farm kicks off operations,"Electrify America, the EV charging company created by Volkswagen in the aftermath of its diesel emissions scandal, said on Tuesday that a new, 75 megawatt solar farm in Southern California is now up and running. Electrify America isn’t operating this solar farm. Instead, the company struck a 15-year virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with renewable energy developer Terra-Gen. It’s the latest development in Electrify America’s efforts to link itself to renewable energy projects. The firms broke ground on the plant back in February. Your typical VPPA involves a buyer, which pays a fixed price for whatever energy is generated, and a seller, which generates the energy and sells it via the grid for the buyer at market rates. The buyer assumes some risk, because the seller might wind up selling the energy below the fixed rate. Yet, the buyer could also see the upside if market prices trend above the fixed rate. In other words: Electrify America is taking on some risk with this deal, and in exchange it gets to say it’s helping clean up the grid while potentially benefiting from rising energy prices. Renewable energy developers play a crucial role in decarbonizing the grid, but just how far do VPPAs go in mitigating climate change? This seems to be an open question. Even Electrify America’s press release leaves some wiggle room on this front: “This brand new construction contributes to ‘additionality,’ by producing new renewable energy that may not otherwise be available,” the company said in a statement (emphasis ours).  Might another buyer have stepped in if Electrify America hadn’t? Like any offset-related deal, it’s difficult to say whether the agreement is facilitating something that definitively would not have happened otherwise. (If you are aware of any academic studies on the environmental impact of VPPAs, please get in touch at harri.weber@techcrunch.com.) For its part, Electrify America states that the peak energy its investment will generate is “comparable to the power drawn by 500 EVs charging at once at an average speed of 150 kilowatts.” The solar farm’s annual “production is projected at 225 Gigawatt-hours,” Electrify America adds. In an earlier press release, the firm claimed the outcome of this deal will be “comparable to the carbon sequestered by planting nearly 40 million trees.” VW subsidiary Electrify America to add Tesla connectors to EV charging network"

The platform slowed down the speed it takes when accessing links to a handful of websites, including The New York Times, Instagram, Facebook, Bluesky, Threads, Reuters and Substack. The platform appears to be reversing the slow access to news sites on Tuesday afternoon. All of these websites have been publicly attacked by Musk in the past. When clicking on links to these websites on X, there was a five-second delay in loading the web pages. The delays were noticed by users on the Hacker News forum and were first reported by The Washington Post. By delaying traffic to these websites, Musk and X were potentially taking away traffic and ad revenue from these companies. Delays, even small ones, can affect a website’s traffic as users can grow impatient when content doesn’t load within a second or two. A quick test showed that other major news organizations and websites, such as YouTube and Fox News, are unaffected. As far as we can tell, the delays only impacted websites that Musk has previously attacked or ridiculed. Twitter’s former head of trust and safety posted on Bluesky that the delays appeared to be “one of those things that seems too crazy to be true, even for Twitter, until you see it inexplicably take 5 seconds for Chrome to receive 650 bytes of data.” He went on to note that “UX research on web performance suggests that even a 1 second delay is enough for people to start to context switch, which increases bounce rates and decreases time spent on the linked site. Delays are annoying enough, even subconsciously, to drive people away.” Additionally, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded with a “thinking face emoji” to a Threads post referencing the throttling issue earlier today. Musk is currently feuding with Zuckerberg, and threatened to show up to Zuckerberg’s residence for a cage fight that the two previously discussed but never formally scheduled. This isn’t the first time that Musk has let his personal grievances affect the social network, as he previously blocked links to Substack, Threads and other competitors. Earlier this year, Musk called the New York Times “propaganda” and took away the news organization’s verification check mark. X did not respond to comment, which isn’t a surprise, given that the social media has stopped responding to press inquiries ever since Musk took over the company last year. Update 08/15/2023 5:05 PM ET: The article was updated to indicate that X started reversing the slow access to news sites on Tuesday afternoon."
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/chicken-soup-for-the-soul-entertainment-q2-2023-earnings/,TechCrunch,Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment cuts costs a year after buying Redbox,"A year after Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE) purchased Redbox for $375 million, the company continues to be hit by losses and looks to reduce costs across all aspects of its business. CSSE reported its second-quarter 2023 earnings this week, which showed a net loss of $43.7 million — more than double the $20.8 million it lost in the year-ago period. However, the company also reported $79.9 million in revenue, up from $37.6 million in the second quarter of 2022. Still, total revenue failed to live up to Wall Street expectations. The poor results were in large part thanks to the 2022 acquisition of Redbox for $50 million in stock and the assumption of $325 million in debt. To pay down its debt, CSSE says it wants to cut down on operating expenses, hold off on content acquisition deals, and focus on other revenue streams like marketing Redbox kiosk screen time to third-party advertisers. The company recently struck a deal with TikTok to bring popular content to over 3,000 digital video screens at Redbox kiosks. Redbox also expanded its partnership with Dollar General to roll out 1,500 more kiosks to its stores over the next two years. CSSE announced during the earnings call that it is shutting down the Seattle-based office, and those employees will work remotely. In January, the company reduced its workforce by 4%. Additionally, CSSE plans to assemble a strategic review committee in the coming weeks to discuss an array of other options. Most notably, CEO Bill Rouhana told Media Play News that the company is considering a potential sale or partnership but declined to elaborate. “There have been some inquiries that have come our way that could be pretty serious, which is why we are setting up the committee,” Rouhana said. During the call, Rouhana cited the uncertain media environment as being the cause of its unsatisfactory quarter, with the ongoing writer and actor strikes being the newest concern. “There have been massive changes in the media space and in the broader economy and they’re affecting everyone,” Rouhana said. “This is an entire industry that is feeling some pain, but despite these changes, we are fully committed to growing our business and streamlining it in the most cost-effective way, and we’re capable of doing that.” However, Rouhana believes the strikes will increase the demand for library titles, which gives Redbox a chance to prove its worth. “We have a large catalog we can monetize in the event of a prolonged slowdown,” added Rouhana. “In other words, the longer the strike continues, the more valuable the library becomes.” Redbox generated $30.9 million in disc rental revenue in Q2, slightly down from $32.3 million in the previous quarter. CSSE’s streaming business — Redbox Digital and Crackle Plus, among other platforms — earned $31.7 million, compared to $34.6 million in the first quarter."
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/the-startup-landscape-has-shifted-dramatically-accelerators-must-adapt-or-fade-away/,TechCrunch,The startup landscape has shifted dramatically: Accelerators must adapt or fade away,"Unparalleled contrasts have marked the last decade and a half — from the devastating plunge of a major housing crash to the soaring heights of the longest bull market and the unforeseen havoc of a global pandemic. Amid these turbulent times, the VC accelerator industry has emerged as a stalwart player. Fueled by a zero-interest landscape in 2020, it has surged, giving rise to an ever-growing array of funds. That said, a paradigm shift of the broader venture landscape could be on the horizon. Starting a tech company today costs 99% less than it did 18 years ago when Y Combinator was started (today and 2005), largely due to the emergence of cloud technologies, no-code tools, and artificial intelligence. There is an unprecedented amount of information or knowledge that is now freely available to guide founders (e.g., the free YC Startup School courses). Network effects have evolved, moving away from the traditional physical spaces to digital ones. Digital communities and social platforms such as Twitter, Signal NFX, YC’s co-founder matching, and Slack communities (e.g., Flyover Tech) have played a significant role in this shift. At the start of 2022, there were $1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and $230 billion in VC dry powder, figures that dwarf the prefinancial crisis AUM by a factor of five. Concurrently, the number of funds raised in the eight-year period up to 2022 was 2,700, up from 883 in 2010. Crowdfunding witnessed a 2.4x growth from 2020 to 2021. Angel investments in 2022 equaled those from 2006 to 2011 combined. Family office investments increased by 5x, and corporate venture investments rose 6x, thus opening new capital avenues for founders who found it difficult to raise capital. The competitive landscape also underwent significant changes. At the dawn of 2022, there were 2,900 active VC firms, marking a 225% increase since 2008. This influx of funds has propelled platform VCs to step up their game, nurturing their portfolios and winning deals more aggressively. Finally, the talent pool for tech startups has broadened immensely. Factors such as remote work, offshore development, and the steadily growing labor pool of software engineers have enabled startups to hire additional engineering talent, adding yet another catalyst to this vibrant ecosystem. Importantly, the traditional accelerator model has enjoyed the fruits of these potential paradigm shifts. The number of accelerators has more than doubled since 2014, while the number of accelerator-backed startups in the U.S. has nearly quadrupled in the same time period (investments from 2005 to 2015 and total investments through 2021). However, as we look into the future, founders must confront a key question: Are there too many accelerators now, and is joining an accelerator even needed anymore? The idea that accelerator funds have little value grew in popularity during the pandemic, as capital was so abundant that first-time founders began bypassing accelerators altogether. Moreover, rumors of deeply unethical behavior at accelerators are starting to surface frequently. The most notable example was allegations of fraud at Newchip, a popular virtual startup accelerator. The liquidation of Newchip sent ripples through the startup ecosystem as perceptions of grifting at accelerators gained momentum online. Another instance of negative press involved the On Deck accelerator, which laid off 25% of its staff in 2022. The layoff came from a deal that went sour with Tiger Global, forcing On Deck to use its Series B funds to keep the lights on in the accelerator.

			Founders must confront a key question: Are there too many accelerators now, and is joining an accelerator even needed anymore?

 The fall of players like Newchip and On Deck are not isolated incidents. They testify to the growing realization that accelerators increasingly compete for capital and opportunity with other established, institutional VC firms. For example, when YC was founded in 2005, a “pre-seed” round did not exist, and it cost $500,000 to start a tech company. Now pre-seed rounds have surged in popularity to being the most popular round for getting your business from MVP to $1 million+ ARR. In 2022, there was 10x the amount of capital in the market than a decade ago, with hundreds of pre-seed VC funds in existence with hyper-targeted theses (e.g., psychedelics or construction). The influx of pre-seed venture dollars in circulation has increased competition with accelerators and influenced more funds to pursue a “platform VC” model, with some even having a venture studio (e.g., building companies in-house) or incubator (e.g., long-term support at the earliest stages). In some cases, funds themselves launch “accelerators,” which in most cases are the platform support and capital extended to earlier startups, so the VC invests earlier. Importantly, a VC firm pursuing pre-seed funding escapes the traditional stigmatized accelerator branding due to more favorable terms. Furthermore, many VCs have also built communities around their accelerator model in ways traditional accelerators fail to. Thematic platform VCs have world-class advisors for specific sectors and create cross-pollination within their portfolios. Some pre-seed VCs are focused on backing community-driven startups that have access to communities, hacking distribution and discovery. That said, it’s not just micro VCs or emerging managers who are launching platforms; brand names are, too. For example, Sequoia Capital’s Arc or a16z’s Crypto Startup School attracts quality with favorable terms, capital, and a strong brand. The chart below shows how VCs have adapted through market cycles: Image Credits: Brett Calhoun Platform VCs vary in both definition and focus depending on the logistics of the firm. For example, at Redbud VC, our team manages a VC fund plus some aspects of a studio, including support from world-class operators who have founded billion-dollar companies. In general, VCs have continued to invest earlier, with many now backing idea-stage or pre-product founders. Some firms like K9 Ventures won’t even back founders who have taken prior institutional capital. Due to the increased competition from the platform role and the hunt for untapped early-stage founders, every VC will soon have a platform or studio component. All this said, what is different about an accelerator versus a platform VC, strategic angel, or an early-stage VC in general? If we drill into what an accelerator does for founders, generally speaking, it can be bucketed into: The value of the above is directly correlated to the level of entrepreneurial experience the founder possesses. That said, the value accelerators provide comes at a cost: time and equity. The large equity stakes and extensive work can be a repellant to quality founders. If the value is delivered, the equity can be argued, but the time cannot. Some accelerators are adding 20+ hours of programming per week and networking events that may be lackluster. In Redbud VC’s conversations with 2,000+ founders, our team found that what is truly relevant to founders is network effects and knowledge sharing. Founders are time-strapped, so filtered feedback from successful founders can expedite years of learning, and warm intros can save months. "
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/jumia-expects-losses-not-to-exceed-100m-this-year-per-q3-financials/,TechCrunch,"Jumia expects losses not to exceed $100M this year, per Q3 financials","In the first quarter of 2023, we reported that Jumia recorded its lowest losses in four years. Its adjusted EBITDA and operating losses dropped to $27 million and $30.9 million, respectively. Those numbers represented a 55% and 57% decrease year-over-year, on track to meet the company’s end-of-year target of $100 million to $120 million in adjusted losses. Surprisingly, Jumia’s Q2 2023 financials show that the e-commerce giant outperformed its first-quarter efforts in this regard. The company’s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses fell 66% to $19.3 million and $23.3 million, respectively; as a result, Jumia has lowered its adjusted loss projection for the whole year, predicting a loss of $90 million to $100 million. “We are navigating challenging macro conditions with discipline and focus, doubling our efficiency efforts. Compared to the second quarter of 2022, fulfillment and sales and advertising expenses were down 50% and 74%, respectively,” said Jumia CEO Francis Dufay in a statement. “We are also starting to reap the benefits of our actions on overhead costs with G&A excluding share-based compensation decreasing by a third year-over-year, reaching a 4-year low at $17.7 million.” In Q4 2022, Jumia embarked on a streamlining effort that reduced its headcount by 20%, affecting 900 roles across 11 markets. In an interview the following quarter, Dufay told TechCrunch that more layoffs could happen throughout the year. The e-commerce giant expects to reduce G&A costs by as much as $28 million by Q4, he said. Other streamlining efforts have come from Jumia intentionally recalibrating its product and service portfolio in Q4 2022. The company suspended its first-party grocery offering, logistics-as-a-service and food delivery operations in specific key markets where the economics weren’t sustainable. It also reduced the promotional intensity behind several services on the JumiaPay app. Since the decision, a decline in quarterly active customers, orders and gross merchandise value (GMV) have followed. In Q2 2023, Jumia’s quarterly active customers, orders and GMV declined 28%, 37% and 25% year-over-year to 2.4 million, 6.5 million and $202.3 million, respectively. As a result, total revenue dropped 15% to $48.5 million. Similarly, other macroeconomic conditions have contributed to the drop in numbers in these three categories. For one thing, high inflation is reducing customers’ purchasing power and retailers’ capacity to obtain products owing to import restrictions. The average inflation level across Jumia’s footprint reached 14.1% across the board, with countries like Ghana, Egypt and Nigeria witnessing record-high inflation and currency devaluations these past few months. “Building supply is the right thing to do, especially in a tough market and macroeconomic context. People want cheaper products and better deals. And that’s what we’re building on our platform,” Dufay said in an interview with TechCrunch. “As we keep reducing losses, we’re also working on other growth areas that aren’t showing yet, but we’re confident will pay off. We’re seeing positive signs across many countries where we are reaching inflection points in volumes and sales.” These early signs of success can be seen in markets like Senegal and Ghana, where the electronics and phones categories grew the fastest in GMV in Q2 2023. Jumia pushed into the general merchandise categories (which include phones, electronics and appliances) as it shifted focus from fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and JumiaPay services in the last quarter of 2022. These are big-ticket items (average item value of $42) compared to FMCG products ($7). In addition to increasing Jumia’s average order value to around $31, these general merchandise items have also provided Jumia with an avenue of testing buy now, pay later (BNPL) services in Egypt via JumiaPay. The 10-year-old e-commerce platform has partnered with over 10 banks and fintech players to scale this effort. “Many markets are already well structured, and consumers have a big demand to buy and pay in installments. It’s complex because we need to work with specialized consumer finance providers,” commented Dufay on the call. “There’s a pretty good BNPL system in Egypt and in these countries where there’s a good ecosystem for consumer finance, we’re building the tool to integrate them into the platform and give consumers the right options.” JumiaPay saw its transactions drop 38% to 2.1 million and total payment volume (TPV) decline 23.3% to $56.9 million. To improve these numbers, JumiaPay, which is an enabler for the platform’s commerce and food delivery businesses, is in the process of expanding the range of payment methods that its users can link to and is also deploying “JumiaPay on delivery” in Morocco, Ghana and Uganda after a successful rollout in Kenya and Nigeria in Q1 2023. Jumia noted that in Kenya, 50% of post-paid transactions in Q2 2023 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 7% in Q1. In related news, Jumia says it’s also working on a white-label checkout solution for third-party merchants that will allow them to accept payments on their platforms under their brand name. Meanwhile, Jumia finished the quarter with a liquidity position of $166.3 million, comprising $61 million of cash and cash equivalents and $105.3 million of term deposits and other financial assets."
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/intuitive-machines-sets-november-launch-date-for-lunar-lander-mission/,TechCrunch,Intuitive Machines sets November launch date for lunar lander mission,"Lunar technology company Intuitive Machines may well be the first private American company to land a spacecraft on the moon. The company said Monday that it was targeting a six-day slot starting on November 15 to launch its IM-1 lunar lander mission on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Intuitive Machines is one of three companies that were awarded NASA contracts to deliver payloads to the lunar surface under the agency’s “Commercial Lunar Payload Services” program. (A total of five companies have received awards, including Firefly Space and Astrobotic.) While it seemed like Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic would be the first of these to launch its lander, that company has been majorly hampered by delays to its contracted launch vehicle, United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket. It now appears that Intuitive Machines will beat them to the punch. The company, which went public earlier this year, is planning on delivering the lander to Kennedy Space Center in September, after finishing out some final testing at the company’s Houston facilities. Payload integration with the Falcon 9 payload fairing will take a little over a month, Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said. Should the company miss the November window for any reason, whether that’s bad weather or a technical issue, the company has a backup window in December. A successful touchdown of the company’s Nova-C lander on the lunar surface would be a milestone victory for the company, which has derived most of its revenue to date from NASA and commercial contracts for payload delivery to the moon. For the second quarter, that revenue came to $18 million, with an operating loss of $13.2 million. The company concluded the quarter with $39.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. Much of its future revenue is also from the government: A joint venture between Intuitive Machines and KBR was awarded a $719 million, five-year engineering services contract from NASA, in addition to a contracted backlog of $137.3 million at the end of the second quarter. But working with the government has its own challenges. The Houston-based company withdrew its financial guidance for the full fiscal year due to “delays to government customer acquisition timelines, U.S. federal budget uncertainty and the uncertain cadence of new contractual awards,” according to a press release. Intuitive Machines CFO Erik Sallee told investors during a second-quarter earnings call that the guidance withdrawal was not due to any change or loss in contract awards. “We haven’t lost anything that we previously had in our forecast,” he said. Instead, Altemus said in a statement that the company is looking to diversify its revenue streams, submitting over $3 billion in proposals for opportunities in defense and aerospace, including human spaceflight. The story has been updated to reflect the total number of awardees under NASA’s CLPS program. "
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/configu-raises-a-3m-pre-seed-round-for-its-configuration-as-code-platform/,TechCrunch,Configu raises a $3M pre-seed round for its configuration-as-code platform,"Nobody loves managing configuration files for their applications, and as systems get ever more complex and distributed, errors — and the potential security issues that come with them — can easily multiply. Infrastructure-as-code has gone mainstream over the course of the last few years, and now Tel Aviv–based open source startup Configu wants to bring configuration-as-code for application management to more developers as well. The company this week announced a $3 million pre-seed funding round, led by Cardumen Capital. A number of angel investors, including Ariel Maislos, Marc Epstein, Haim Kopans and Omer Schneider, also participated in this round. The company was co-founded by Peleg Porat (CEO) and Ran Cohen (CTO). Porat previously worked at the likes of McAfee and F5 Networks, while Cohen was previously an engineer at startups like Backand and Testim.io. Image Credits: Configu “Most of the current trends in the code and software domain increase the number of configurations and their complexity because many technologies — and many niche technologies — are around configuration,” Porat explained. “It’s so complex and so fragmented across secret managers and feature flags, tons of files across git repositories. It’s crazy and leads to misconfiguration after misconfiguration, leading to downtime in production and lots of other issues.” He noted that a few years ago, this wasn’t really an issue, so nobody created the tooling for application configuration management. As their systems became more complex, enterprises that now ran into these issues started to build their own DIY solutions, including the Configu founders. “The environment became more complex — it’s much more distributed, we’ve got Kubernetes, we’ve got all highly distributed microservices and all that — and then it went from something that was sort of manageable manually a few years ago to something that was just not manageable anymore,” Cohen added. Image Credits: Configu Configu brings all of these application configuration settings under a single umbrella. The open source version of Configu’s configuration-as-code for application configurations allows developers to store and orchestrate their configuration data across environments and systems. Developers can connect it to their existing configuration settings — whether that’s in a text file, database, feature flag solution or elsewhere and manage it similar to how they would handle their infrastructure-as-code solutions. And because it is now code, they can integrate it with their test frameworks and automate their configuration workflows, too. Like most open source companies, Configu is monetizing its service with a managed cloud version that adds a number of enterprise features like premium service, single sign-on support, role-based access and SOC2 compliance on top of the open source version. The company also offers a free community version for small teams that don’t need these features. “We keep Configu very, very lean,” Porat said. “We believe in community. We have a team in Israel and in the Bay Area and we’re getting support from the community who help us and contribute code to the open source. We see a lot of success with this model.”"
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/openai-proposes-a-new-way-to-use-gpt-4-for-content-moderation/,TechCrunch,OpenAI proposes a new way to use GPT-4 for content moderation,"OpenAI claims that it’s developed a way to use GPT-4, its flagship generative AI model, for content moderation — lightening the burden on human teams. Detailed in a post published to the official OpenAI blog, the technique relies on prompting GPT-4 with a policy that guides the model in making moderation judgments and creating a test set of content examples that might or might not violate the policy. A policy might prohibit giving instructions or advice for procuring a weapon, for example, in which case the example “Give me the ingredients needed to make a Molotov cocktail” would be in obvious violation. Policy experts then label the examples and feed each example, sans label, to GPT-4, observing how well the model’s labels align with their determinations — and refining the policy from there. “By examining the discrepancies between GPT-4’s judgments and those of a human, the policy experts can ask GPT-4 to come up with reasoning behind its labels, analyze the ambiguity in policy definitions, resolve confusion and provide further clarification in the policy accordingly,” OpenAI writes in the post. “We can repeat [these steps] until we’re satisfied with the policy quality.” Image Credits: OpenAI OpenAI makes the claim that its process — which several of its customers are already using — can reduce the time it takes to roll out new content moderation policies down to hours. And it paints it as superior to the approaches proposed by startups like Anthropic, which OpenAI describes as rigid in its reliance on models’ “internalized judgments” as opposed to “platform-specific . . . iteration.” But color me skeptical. AI-powered moderation tools are nothing new. Perspective, maintained by Google’s Counter Abuse Technology Team and the tech giant’s Jigsaw division, launched in general availability several years ago. Countless startups offer automated moderation services as well, including Spectrum Labs, Cinder, Hive and Oterlu, which Reddit recently acquired. And they don’t have a perfect track record. Several years ago, a team at Penn State found that posts on social media about people with disabilities could be flagged as more negative or toxic by commonly used public sentiment and toxicity detection models. In another study, researchers showed that older versions of Perspective often couldn’t recognize hate speech that used “reclaimed” slurs like “queer” and spelling variations such as missing characters. Part of the reason for these failures is that annotators — the people responsible for adding labels to the training datasets that serve as examples for the models — bring their own biases to the table. For example, frequently, there’s differences in the annotations between labelers who self-identified as African Americans and members of the LGBTQ+ community versus annotators who don’t identify as either of those two groups. Has OpenAI solved this problem? I’d venture to say not quite. The company itself acknowledges this: “Judgments by language models are vulnerable to undesired biases that might have been introduced into the model during training,” the company writes in the post. “As with any AI application, results and output will need to be carefully monitored, validated and refined by maintaining humans in the loop.” Perhaps the predictive strength of GPT-4 can help deliver better moderation performance than the platforms that’ve come before it. But even the best AI today makes mistakes — and it’s crucial we don’t forget that, especially when it comes to moderation."
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/tech-jobs-market-h1-2023/,TechCrunch,The tech jobs market is as strong as it ever was,"After the big companies conducted mega layoffs at the beginning of this year, it would be natural to think that the tech unemployment rate would skyrocket. If we think about tech jobs as purely IT, engineering and developer kinds of roles, then those jobs are definitely still in demand and less affected than you might imagine. There’s a big factor working in the favor of tech professionals looking for work: They’re sought after in both the technology industry and across other industries that also require workers with the same technical skills. Those non-technology companies are finally getting a shot at some of the better talent that has been locked in tech industry jobs for the last few years. Still, when you add tens of thousands of people to the unemployment payroll, it’s bound to have an impact eventually — even if all those jobs weren’t pure tech jobs. Right after the latest jobs numbers came out earlier this month, the number of job openings across all sectors fell to its lowest level in two years. What’s more, CompTIA found that tech job posting volume was down, suggesting that companies might have put hiring on hold, at least for the short-term. This hardly seems surprising, given that the Fed has been raising interest rates for the last 19 months with the specific goal of cooling the economy. In fact, over the last year, rates ballooned from 1.68% in July 2022 to over 5% today. The attempts seemed to have worked if the declining jobs data is any indication. Fed interest rate hikes from July 2022 to July 2023 Image Credits: FRED When we looked at the tech jobs outlook in February, we expected it to be worse than it was, but tech jobs growth remained surprisingly strong. Today, the picture isn’t quite as bright — though not awful — but there is clearly a shifting landscape for tech workers. You may recall (or may have stricken it from your memory due to the trauma) that in March 2020, we went into a lockdown. That caused the economy and tech jobs to plunge briefly, but throughout that year and into 2021, companies began recognizing that there was a business opportunity in having so many workers at home. "
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/worldcoin-in-kenya/,TechCrunch,"Worldcoin ignored initial order to stop iris scans in Kenya, records show","Months before Kenya finally banned iris scans by Sam Altman’s crypto startup Worldcoin, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) had ordered its parent company, Tools for Humanity, to stop collecting personal data. The ODPC had in May this year instructed the crypto startup to stop iris scans and the collection of facial recognition and other personal data in Kenya, a letter sent to Worldcoin and seen by TechCrunch shows. Tools for Humanity, the company building Worldcoin, did not stop taking biometric data until early this month when Kenya’s ministry of interior and administration, a more powerful entity, suspended it following its official launch. Worldcoin’s official launch led to a spike in the number of people queuing up to have their eyeballs scanned in exchange for “free money,” drawing the attention of authorities. The letter shows that ODPC had instructed Worldcoin to cease collecting data for intruding on individuals’ privacy by gathering biometric data without a well-established and compelling justification. Further, it said Worldcoin had failed to obtain valid consent from people before scanning their irises, saying its agents failed to inform its subjects about the data security and privacy measures it took, and how the data collected would be used or processed. “Your client is hereby instructed to cease the collection of all facial recognition data and iris scans, from your subscribers. This cessation should be implemented without delay and should include all ongoing and future data processing activities,” said Rose Mosero, in a letter to Tools for Humanity that outlined the concerns. The letter, addressed to Ariana Issaias of Coulson Harney (Bowmans), the law firm representing the crypto startup, also restricted Worldcoin from processing the collected data further and instructed the safe storage of collected information. Details of ODPC’s attempt to stop the collection of biometric data have emerged in a new petition filed before the High Court by the data protection authority. The deputy data commissioner of compliance, Oscar Otieno, in an affidavit filed in court in August, said that it started the “assessment” of the respondents (Tools for Humanity and Sense Marketing Limited) in 2022. In May this year, it carried out further inquiry on their processing activities and directed that they cease processing sensitive personal data immediately. “The applicant (ODPC) is aware that despite the suspension and directive to cease processing of personal data, the respondents continued to process the said personal data. It took the public directive by the cabinet ministry of interior and coordination to halt the operations of the respondents (Tools for Humanity and Sense Marketing),” said Otieno in the affidavit.   The ODPC sought the court’s help to have Worldcoin compelled to preserve the data it collected from Kenyans, as it finalizes (the multi-agency) investigations around security, privacy, and the legality of using “financial incentive” to obtain biometric data. Since the filing of the petition, the High Court has barred Worldcoin from collecting data from Kenyans and directed it, its agents, its representatives and its employees to preserve all information collected locally from April 19 to August 8. “Worldcoin is committed to working with partners globally to ensure the project complies with regulatory requirements and provides a safe, secure and transparent service. We remain committed to working with regulatory officials in Kenya to provide Kenyans access to the global digital economy,” Worldcoin Foundation told TechCrunch in response to claims that it had ignored initial order to stop processing data. The petition has emerged after Worldcoin activities were suspended in Kenya on August 2, by Kithure Kindiki, the country’s cabinet secretary for interior and national administration. Kindiki said the ban will remain in place until the authorities determine “the absence of any risks to the general public whatsoever.” “Relevant security, financial service and data protection agencies have commenced inquiries and investigations to establish the authenticity and legality of the aforesaid activities, and the safety and protection of the data being harvested, and how the harvesters intend to use the data,” said Kindiki. Worldcoin claims to be creating a new “human identity (World ID) and financial network” through iris scans done by “Orb,” the company’s spherical scanners to “verify your World ID,” and its own cryptocurrency “WLD.” Kenya was one of the first countries where Worldcoin launched sign-ups and had been one of the biggest markets for takeup. After the global official launch at the end of July, locals who had received the tokens could sell them for USDT (the stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar) on crypto exchanges or to “brokers” in exchange for cash. In Kenya, that promise of “free money” quickly spread across the country, leading to an influx of people at the recruitment (Orb) stations, which drew the attention of top government officials, leading to the suspension of Worldcoin iris scans. The crypto startups said it hopes to resume activities in Kenya soon. Alongside the many issues that skeptical peers in the technology industry have been raising about the Worldcoin project and its bigger business ambitions, there are growing concerns about how those efforts to build a biometric database using the promise of free cryptocurrency have exploited economically disadvantaged people. Also, some of these issues have been there in plain sight. An MIT Technology Review investigation — published last year — found that it “used deceptive marketing practices, was collecting more personal data than it acknowledged, and failed to obtain meaningful informed consent.” Updated on August 23 at 12:44pm EAT to include a comment from Worldcoin "

The new feature gives users a way to keep up with what a writer is doing without having to subscribe to their newsletter. The company says that since launching its Twitter-like Notes feature in April, following has been one of the most requested features from writers and readers. Users can find friends to follow by syncing their phone contacts with Substack. “Following helps writers grow their audience via the Substack network, which is already home to millions of the world’s most valuable readers,” Substack wrote in a blog post. “We built this feature to help maximize — and not replace — subscriptions, which will always be the most important type of relationship on Substack. A follow offers a lightweight way to start a relationship with a writer or reader, with the option to convert it into a subscription at any time.” By following a writer, you can can stay up to date with what they’re reading, liking, publishing, and subscribing to — through the Notes feed and on their profiles. Substack says that although the “Subscribe” button will remain the primary focus when you encounter writers you’re not already following, users will now see a smaller “Follow” button on individual notes and profiles. You will also see Follow buttons on lists of suggested accounts. The platform will encourage users who follow writers to also subscribe to their newsletters. For instance, each time a writer publishes a note, their followers will see it and be prompted to subscribe. In the future, Substack will make “upsells” to subscriptions easier by automatically notifying followers about trending posts and other milestones. “In addition to creating this new subscription pathway, the follow feature will help readers more easily share your writing,” Substack notes. “For example, if a reader likes or restacks one of your posts, their followers may see that activity in their Notes feed. That means that writers will benefit from these new features even if they’re not active on Notes.” Although Substack is best known as a newsletter platform, the company has been working on developing traditional social networking features. The addition of a Follow button indicates that the platform is serious about branching out beyond a newsletter platform. Substack has been looking to take on X (formerly known as Twitter) ever since Elon Musk took the reins of the company last year. The company took a direct shot at X last year, when it warned in a post that “Twitter is changing, and it’s tough to predict what might be next.” The post had encouraged creators of all sorts to port their Twitter follower base to Substack. Today’s announcement brings the Substack user experience more in line with X’s."

Thankfully, it appears the pre-seed market is starting to recover, per new data from Carta, which provides cap table management software for startups. More: 5 founders discuss why SAFEs are better for early-stage and bridge rounds The news is not all good, though — for founders, at least. The data indicates investor-friendly terms are becoming more common, which is not entirely unexpected. As the venture market has cooled and investors became pickier, founders have found it more difficult to bargain for clean term sheets or aggressive valuations. So, what can founders expect if they’re looking to raise their first round of capital these days? Let’s find out. Shameless plug: The Builders Stage at Disrupt this year is going to have a lot of related material on fundraising and scaling startups. Come hang out! Altogether, pre-seed startups that use Carta raised $972 million in the second quarter, 17% more than they did in the first quarter. That kind of recovery feels material, but the difference is stark when you consider the fact that funding to pre-seed startups remained above the $1.40 billion mark throughout the first half of 2022. (Note that Carta’s customers are mostly based in the United States, so this data primarily reflects trends in the U.S.) Still, it seems fewer deals were closed in that period, marking the fourth straight quarter of declines in the number of pre-seed deals: Carta recorded 1,608 pre-seed rounds in the second quarter, down from 1,820 in the first quarter. More dollars with fewer rounds appears to be the story of the pre-seed market in these times. Now, let’s get into the weeds.  "

Add to that a declining user base and it begs the question, what’s next for Robinhood? We’re excited to announce that we’ll all learn the answer to that question when Vlad Tenev, the company’s co-founder and CEO, joins us on the Fintech Stage for a session called “What’s Robinhood’s Next Chapter?” on September 19 during TechCrunch Disrupt 2023. The company has been busy expanding its product portfolio. Last year, it unveiled Robinhood Retirement, an IRA designed for people — think gig workers and contractors — who work outside the typical 9–5 grind. They generally find it hard to save for retirement without full-time job benefits like employer-sponsored 401K plans. This past June, the company acquired X1, a no-fee credit card startup, for $95 million. The slowdown in crypto trading and a decline in Robinhood’s core trading business may be the impetus for diversifying its business. Fintech’s been a roller-coaster ride for just about everyone since the highs of 2021 — as Tenev can readily attest. We’re looking forward to learning what to expect in the popular trading app’s next chapter. Vlad Tenev co-founded Robinhood with Baiju Bhatt in 2013 with a mission to democratize finance. They served as co-CEOs and co-presidents until 2020, when Tenev took on those roles. He is also chair of the company’s board of directors. Prior to Robinhood, Tenev started two finance companies in New York City. Tenev holds a degree in mathematics from Stanford University and an MS in mathematics from UCLA.

2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/setapp-announces-plans-to-launch-an-alt-app-store-for-eu-users/,TechCrunch,Setapp announces plans to launch an alt app store for EU users,"App subscription service Setapp is preparing to launch as an alternative app store, as soon as new EU regulations come into effect next year. The company is betting on the EU’s Digital Markets Act’s (DMA) rules that should allow users to install third-party apps on iOS without having to go through Apple’s App Store. However, how Apple chooses to interpret the new law remains unclear. A December 2022 report from Bloomberg indicated Apple was preparing to allow alternative app stores on iPhones and iPads to come into compliance with the DMA, despite its ongoing concerns over the security issues involved with “sideloading” apps, which can impact consumers’ safety and privacy. But, the report noted, the tech giant was still discussing other ideas about how this new system would work — perhaps even requiring these apps to be verified by Apple for a fee. In the meantime, though, Setapp is moving forward with the assumption that Apple devices will ultimately have to support third-party app stores and is working on plans to launch its own. The company today offers an app subscription service where users pay a fee of $9.99 per month in order to gain access to over 240 apps for their Mac, including utilities, productivity software, customization tools, lifestyle applications, and more. Other plans include those that also offer apps for iOS devices ($12.49/mo), for power users with more devices ($14.99/mo), in addition to family plans and Setapp for teams. For the new stand-alone app store, Setapp claims to have over 30 partners on board prepared to offer their apps, including Ulysses, Taskheat, NotePlan, PDFSearch, and Soulver, according to its press release. It’s also calling for more developers to submit their own. The company aims to entice developers with better revenue shares than Apple provides. The company offers a 70/30 split with developers when customers use their app during the month, but it additionally shares 20% with developers who bring in new customers — that means developers have the potential to earn up to 90% from Setapp’s user fees every month. “With 60% of developers interested in distributing their iOS apps through third-party app stores, we are excited to extend our support to iOS-only developers and provide them with a platform to grow users and add revenue streams,” said Oleksandr Kosovan, founder and CEO of Setapp, in a statement. The company is offering a waitlist for customers who want to hear about the new store when it launches."
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/linear-tv-viewing-sinks-below-50-nielsen-july-2023-report/,TechCrunch,Linear TV viewing sinks below 50% as streaming soars to new heights,"In a first for linear TV viewing, cable and broadcast usage fell below 50% in terms of total share among U.S. viewers, according to Nielsen’s July 2023 report. Cable viewing dropped below 30% for the first time at 29.6%, down 12.5% year-over-year. Broadcast usage decreased to 20%, down 5.4% YoY. Streaming services, on the other hand, accounted for 38.7% of total U.S. TV usage — a new record high for the category. Streaming usage has sky-rocketed 25.3% in the past year. Moreover, there are three streaming platforms in particular that accomplished notable shares of TV usage in July. YouTube and Netflix were top contributors to the rise in streaming viewership, with shares climbing to 9.2% and 8.5%, respectively. Also, Prime Video recorded a personal best in terms of share; viewing was 3.4%, up 5% compared to June. Image Credits: Nielsen Streaming has occupied the TV usage throne for years now. For instance, streaming viewership exceeded cable usage for the first time last year, according to Nielsen, representing a 34.8% share of total TV viewing in the U.S. However, this doesn’t make the new milestone for broadcast and cable any less bleak. To further put things into perspective, linear TV’s share of viewing represented 63.6% of total TV usage in June 2021, per Nielsen. Now it represents only 49.6%. Previously, cord-cutters pointed to streaming services’ low prices as the reason for dropping their cable TV packages. However, this may no longer be the case. The Financial Times recently published data that showed the top U.S. platforms will cost $87 per month in total this fall. The average cable subscription is cheaper at $83 per month, according to the FT. In order to limit billion-dollar streaming losses, many companies have implemented subscription price hikes. Last week, Disney announced yet another round of price increases for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Additionally, Netflix removed its basic ad-free plan in the U.S., the U.K. and Canada in an effort to drive customers to its $15.49/month standard tier. Disney’s price hike comes as Disney+ continues to lose subscribers for the third consecutive quarter. The company also said that it would follow in Netflix’s footsteps regarding password-sharing rules. Subsequently, tons of users are turning to free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) services to get their entertainment fix. Samba TV recently reported that one in three U.S. users subscribes to FAST services such as Freevee, Pluto TV, Tubi, the Roku Channel and Crackle. As FAST viewing continues to be a growing trend, it’s likely that major subscription video streaming services will have a difficult time convincing customers that they’re worth the hefty price tag."

The features include tools to see definitions of unfamiliar terms, those that help to improve your understanding and coding information across languages, and an interesting feature that lets you tap into the AI power of SGE while you’re browsing. The company explains that these improvements aim to help people better understand complicated concepts or complex topics, boost their coding skills and more. One of the new features will let you hover over certain words to preview their definitions and see related images or diagrams related to the topic, which you can then tap on to learn more. This feature will become available across Google’s AI-generated responses to topics or questions related to certain subjects, like STEM, economics, history and others, where you may encounter terms you don’t understand or concepts you want to dive deeper into for a better understanding. Bing Chat also offers a feature similar to this that lets you highlight the text in question on a page and then select Bing from the options menu to engage in a conversation where you can learn more about the topic. Image Credits: Google Another new feature will help those using SGE for programming assistance. The new capabilities will make it easier to understand and debug the generated code, says Google. Currently, SGE provides AI-generated overviews that help with tasks related to programming languages and tools, allowing users to find answers to their how-to questions or see generated code snippets. The new update will now color-code segments of code with syntax highlights, making it easier to identify different elements like keywords, comments and strings. SGE while browsing may be the most interesting new addition, but for now it’s only an early experiment in Search Labs, available on the Google app for Android and iOS and later, Chrome on the desktop. The feature is designed to help web users engage with long-form content from publishers and creators, to make it easier to find what they’re looking for. Image Credits: Google For instance, on some web pages, you can tap to see an AI-generated list of the key points an article covers with links that take you directly to the part you were looking for. The page will also include an “Explore on page” option where you can see the questions an article answers and then jump to the relevant section. The feature is reminiscent of the existing content highlighting search feature that will jump you to relevant text when you search for specific terms and a matching result is found. However, this time it’s powered by AI. Rival Bing Chat also already offers a similar feature that lets you tap the Bing Chat icon while reading an article or document online and ask Chat to summarize the content for you — so this, again, is a little bit of catch-up on Google’s part. Image Credits: Google Google notes this feature will not provide AI summaries for paywalled articles, and publishers can choose to block the feature by designating their content as paywalled in the Help Center. Image Credits: Google Google and Bing are not the only ones thinking about how AI can be used to summarize text. News reading app Artifact, from Instagram’s founders, also began offering an AI summary feature as of its April 2023 update. SGE while browsing is available as a stand-alone experiment in Search Labs, and will automatically roll out to those who have already opted into SGE. The features follow other new additions to SGE, including a feature launched earlier this month that shows videos and images related to users’ search queries. Search Labs is available through the Google app on Android and iOS and Chrome on the desktop."
2023-08-15,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/youtube-music-adding-tiktok-style-samples-short-form-video-feed/,TechCrunch,YouTube Music is adding a TikTok-style ‘Samples’ short-form video feed,"YouTube Music is launching a new TikTok-style short-form personalized video feed called “Samples,” the company announced on Monday. Each clip in the feed offers a glimpse into the artist, music video and feel of a song recommended to you. As with TikTok and other copycat short-form video feeds, users can swipe vertically in the new Samples feed to discover songs and music videos. Brandon Bilinski, one of YouTube’s directors of product management, told TechCrunch in an interview that the company is seeing that users are discovering more and more music through short-form video. “One of the biggest insights we’ve seen over the past couple of years is that all users but especially younger users are discovering more and more music through short-form video,” Bilinski said. “Friends and family is always number one. If you ask people how they discover music, they always say friends and family, but just recently short-form video climbed into a close number two. We sort of took that insight and we decided to make a discovery focused, short-form video experience solely focused around music.” The Samples feed leverages YouTube’s catalog of official music videos and live footage to power the feed. Instead of simply swiping through countless songs, the feed also encourages users to interact with the song and click through to watch an entire music video or recording of a live performance. So, in other words, YouTube Music is using short-form video clips to promote the discovery of long-form video content on the platform, while also helping users discover new music. Image Credits: YouTube When swiping through the feed, users can add a song to their collection, share it with others, create a playlist, visit the album page, kick off a new radio station or use the song to create a Short. “The feed is sort of an all-encompassing collection of related music to your tastes,” Bilinski said. “The focus is on discovery, but based on what you listen to. It’s pretty diverse, as long as the user’s tastes are diverse. And then we also want to show you stuff you haven’t seen before or listened to before. We will also show you some videos from music you’ve listened to before if you haven’t seen the video.” The launch of the new feed is similar to the TikTok-style discovery feeds that Spotify rolled out earlier this year. The feeds allow users to preview an album, playlist or single by combining a track’s audio with video. The concept behind both YouTube Music and Spotify’s feeds is discovery through a visual aspect in a way that borrows from TikTok’s popular format.  When asked if YouTube Music plans to launch additional video feeds, Bilinski said the company is investigating it as a next step, but noted that YouTube Music wanted to start with a broad and simple feed first before rolling out more. YouTube Music plans to explore how this type of short-form discovery can be incorporated in other parts of the app and look to roll out new experiences that make it easy to discover new artists and their music. The new Samples tab is beginning to roll out today to YouTube Music users on both iOS and Android globally."
2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/tesla-reassures-chinese-users-on-data-security-amid-spying-concerns/,TechCrunch,Tesla reassures Chinese users on data security amid spying concerns,"The relationship between American tech giants and the Chinese government has never been an easy one. We reported previously how Apple finds itself in a predicament as it strives to conquer the colossal smartphone market in China, the world’s largest. The tech giant has to balance appeasing both Beijing and Western politicians, which tend to disagree on data regulation and censorship. Now as Tesla becomes a major electric vehicle player in China, it finds itself in a similar dilemma. A recent, wide-ranging update to Beijing’s anti-espionage legislation is also prompting foreign firms to take a closer look at the risks of operating in the country that has turned national security into a top priority. Foreign automakers have been in China for decades, but internet-connected vehicles have given rise to a slew of new data-compliance requirements that did not affect traditional carmakers. Tesla has already encountered data security backlashes in the country. Over the past weekend, local media reported that an airport in a Southern city with a population of 1 million had banned Tesla vehicles from parking due to “confidentiality concerns,” though drop-offs and pick-ups are still allowed. An airport worker told the press that “many places have a similar rule.” The policy is supposedly a response to Tesla’s “sentry mode.” The feature, which uses a car’s external cameras to detect suspicious activity when the vehicle is left unattended, is designed to guard against break-ins and thefts. And despite similar features in other local EV makers, Tesla’s foreign identity clearly results in more trust issues. In response to the media attention, Tesla stated in a Weibo post that data generated from Sentry Mode is “only stored offline on the USB device inside the car,” and, unlike some other brands, “neither the owner nor Tesla” can remotely view the vehicle’s surroundings online. According to Tesla China’s website, Sentry Mode needs to be activated manually in the car’s system setting and the camera will only begin recording when a threat is detected, provided that a USB flash drive is also in place. Users “must review and comply with local laws, regulations, and any applicable rules regarding the use of cameras and assume full responsibility,” the website notes. This isn’t the first time that Tesla cars have been known to be excluded from public venues. In May 2021, Reuters reported that some government compounds in China had barred Tesla vehicles from entering. In its Weibo post, Tesla also reminds the public that it had long set up a data localization center in accordance with China’s automobile data protection measures introduced in 2021. The guideline, which aims to “protect drivers’ privacy and safeguard national security,” requires “vital data” to be stored within China if it “involves such things as China’s military, government, traffic, and logistics information, as well as electric vehicles’ charging networks.” Visual information about an airport’s surroundings seems to easily fall into one of these categories. Apple is among the few remaining American tech giants that maintain a significant presence in China. Like Tesla, it faces data privacy issues in the country, but its challenge is amplified by its colossal app store that requires close and timely oversight to ensure app developers adhere to China’s intricate internet regulations. Tesla will soon face a new issue around data isolation once it switches Full Self-Driving on for Chinese users. Speculation has been around for months that the advanced driving feature will be available in China in 2023. The situation presents a dilemma similar to that faced by TikTok in the U.S.: How can a company effectively carry out AI training with foreign user data if it is prohibited from exporting that data to its home country on the one hand, while it’s probably reluctant to entrust its foreign staff with its proprietary algorithms to conduct on-the-ground training on the other? There might be a solution, according to this Twitter user: We shall see the technical viability of such a solution or other methods when FSD finally arrives in China. Privacy challenges aside, it will also take Tesla “at least 12 months” to localize FSD for China’s complex road conditions, said the former AI head of Tesla’s Chinese rival, Xpeng. FSD has a long way to go in the world’s largest EV market."
2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/indian-court-ruling-threatens-google-advertising-revenue-model/,TechCrunch,"Google required to remove ads that violate trademarks, Indian court rules","The Delhi High Court has ruled that Google’s Ads program falls under the purview of the country’s Trademarks Act and the company must remove ads that infringe upon trademarks in a major decision that may redefine online advertising’s legal landscape. The decision (PDF), delivered by a division bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice Amit Mahajan last week, observed that Google was an “active participant” in the use of the trademarks of proprietors. Google’s practice of suggesting competitors’ trademarks as keywords to advertisers yielded significant profits for the search giant via keyword sales. This case was spurred by a complaint from logistics firm DRS, which pointed out that searches for its trademark “Agarwal Packers and Movers” returned competitor websites. DRS alleged that Google’s ad mechanism exploited its trademark to divert users to rival sites. Upholding the initial order, the division bench directed Google to act on DRS’s grievances and remove offending ads. This verdict implies that platforms like Google must introduce novel systems to address such trademark concerns continually. “One of the worst ways to spend money as a business is to advertise against your own keywords,” said Nithin Kamath, founder and chief executive of trading platform Zerodha, of the ruling in a thread on X. “Businesses do this because if they don’t, competitors who advertise for their keywords show up above them in search results. So if you search for Zerodha, an ad from a competitor might show up above the organic search result. Many times these ads can be deceiving as well. This perverse situation was the result of the lack of trademark protection.” The court’s assertion that Google is not a “passive intermediary” but runs an advertisement business, over which it has “pervasive control,” comes as a significant blow to the tech giant. “Merely because the said business is run online and is dovetailed with its service as an intermediary, does not entitle Google to the benefit of Section 79(1) of the IT (Information Technology) Act, in so far as the Ads Programme is concerned,” the bench ruled. While Google argued its position as an intermediary entitled it to “safe harbor,” the bench said they found no issue in the prior single judge’s order, which suggested that the “benefit of safe harbor under Section 79(1) of the IT Act would not be available to it” if they were found guilty of trademark infringement. This decision casts a shadow on the tech giant’s advertising operations in one of its largest markets."
2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/rocket-lab-to-launch-a-pair-of-climate-satellites-for-nasa/,TechCrunch,Rocket Lab to launch a pair of climate satellites for NASA,"Rocket Lab will launch two small satellites for NASA that could help scientists better understand how a warming climate will affect the massive ice shelves at Earth’s poles. The PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission will gather data on how much far-infrared energy is emitted at the poles, and how those emissions change throughout the day and year. Far-infrared is a poorly understood portion of Earth’s energy spectrum, though nearly 60% of Arctic emissions occur at these wavelengths. The two satellites, each the size of a bread loaf, will be equipped with a miniaturized instrument called a thermal IR spectrometer. Scientists will be able to compare the data to conditions in cloud cover and sea ice levels below, and hopefully generate more accurate climate models into the future. Across two launches scheduled for May 2024, Rocket Lab will use its Electron rocket to carry the two CubeSats to near-polar orbits, where they’ll collect data for at least 10 months. The launches will take place from Rocket Lab’s launch site on Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand, and will likely occur in rapid succession due to the specific requirements of the mission. Meeting such requirements “is made possible by Electron’s unique ability to deploy dedicated small satellite missions on highly responsive timelines,” the company said in a statement. NASA awarded the launch contract as part of its Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare (VADR) program, a massive contract vehicle that has a budget of $300 million across five years to put NASA payloads on commercial rockets. These launches will be the seventh and eighth the company has conducted on behalf of NASA since 2018. Earlier this year, Rocket Lab successfully placed four of the space agency’s storm-watching satellites into orbit. Those launches were also awarded under the VADR program. The exact value of the launch contract was not disclosed by Rocket Lab or NASA. TechCrunch has inquired into the value and will update the story if they respond."

That probably says more about my general lack of preparedness than anything, of course, but I was reminded both times how much is sucks attempting to use a wet touchscreen. I wouldn’t say it’s the largest single issue facing smartphones today, but in an era when device makers seem to be focused on little more than spec races and unusual form factors, it’s good to see a company tackling a genuine usability issue. OnePlus is showcasing “Rain Water Touch,” a feature designed make wet touchscreens more useable. 9to5 Google spotted the news, which debuted on the hardware maker’s Weibo channel. Image Credits: OnePlus The video showcases a OnePlus device going head-to-head with iPhone 14 Pro, while being mercilessly bombarded by artificial rain and fog. It should help with recently washed or very sweaty hands, as well. OnePlus says the system utilizes a combination of silicon and a custom algorithm to determine finger placement and work around the issues with water, which conducts electrical signals, like the human hand. The feature is set to debut on the Ace 2 Pro, which will be officially unveiled in China later this week. Presumably the feature will be added to other upcoming OnePlus releases, as well as those from its parent brand, Oppo."
2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/amazons-devices-chief-is-stepping-down-this-year/,TechCrunch,Amazon’s devices chief is stepping down this year,"David Limp is set to step down from his role as head of Amazon’s consumer devices division later this year. Amazon has confirmed the news with TechCrunch, following a Wall Street Journal report. Limp has been the company’s Senior Vice President of devices and services for more than 13 years. In the role he has headed up the division that includes the Echo/Alexa, along with products like Amazon’s line of Fire tablets. The move follows widespread reports that its massive bets on the smart home haven’t paid off the way it was clearly hoping. In November, the division was reported to be operating at a staggering $5 billion a year revenue loss. It was among those departments heavily hit by widespread layoffs. All told, Amazon has slashed around 27,000 roles, as CEO Andy Jassy has implemented cost cutting measures amid economic headwinds. “Dave will remain in his role for the next few months, and we’ll announce his successor in the coming weeks,” Jassy notes. “I remain excited and quite optimistic about the products and services we’re building in Devices and Services—we’re at the relative beginning of what’s possible and what I believe these businesses will add for customers and the company. Nevertheless, Jassy and Co. have insisted that the company is committed long term to consumer hardware generally and the Echo line specifically. Last week, Amazon revealed that Alexa head Rohit Prasad would be heading up expanded efforts to remain competitive in white hot generative AI and large language model efforts. Limp addressed the news in a blog post today, stating “It’s time.” He adds: The company is set to reveal a news lineup of devices on September 20 at an event in Arlington, Va., the site of its secondary HQ2 offices. Prior to his nearly 14 years at Amazon, Limp worked at Apple and Palm. “Under Dave’s leadership, Amazon has become one of the world’s leading innovators in building devices and underlying services that customers love,” says Jassy. “From Kindle readers to Fire TV to Alexa and Echo, over the past decade and a half we’ve been able to invent and keep improving experiences that help make our customers’ lives better every day.”"
2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/a-merger-thats-good-for-workers-and-consumers/,TechCrunch,A merger that’s good for workers and consumers,"After an exhaustive review by regulators in the United States and across the globe, Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard is on track to close later this year. The European Commission approved the transaction in May, the Federal Trade Commission has suspended its administrative challenge, and negotiations are underway with the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority. As the newly elected president of the Communications Workers of America, I am extremely encouraged by these developments. Thanks to the regulatory process, this deal will significantly enhance competition in the video game industry while securing workers’ rights and consumer interests. In a complaint filed to block the acquisition, the FTC commissioners expressed concern that Microsoft would stifle competition by withholding popular Activision video games from other game consoles and streaming services. The concessions Microsoft has made to win approval from the European Commission not only address those concerns, but they also expand the availability of Activision titles to additional cloud gaming services that did not previously carry titles like Call of Duty. That’s a significant win for consumers. Under the terms of the merger, Microsoft will be doing more to ensure that its games are available on multiple platforms than Activision Blizzard is currently doing and more than its chief competitor, Sony, which blocks U.S.-based competitors from competing in Japan’s gaming market. For workers, the potential benefits are even more dramatic.

			The FTC commissioners expressed concern that Microsoft would stifle competition.

 The technology and video game industries are notorious for enabling toxic and discriminatory work environments and for fighting workers who want to organize a union. I have seen this firsthand. Prior to my election as president of CWA, as district vice president for the south-central region of the United States, I supported the historic efforts of YouTube music contractors who successfully voted to  join our union. Now YouTube parent company Alphabet is refusing to recognize the union. At Apple, my region’s Oklahoma City store was the second in the United States to win union representation, and in the course of our organizing, we uncovered evidence of racial inequities in the opportunities available to workers. Employer resistance to workers’ collective action has been particularly prevalent at Activision Blizzard. When quality assurance workers at two studios decided to address their low pay and other poor working conditions by organizing to join our union, the company responded with a relentless and illegal campaign to prevent them from even holding a vote. Microsoft has taken a different approach. The company worked with us to negotiate an unprecedented, enforceable labor neutrality agreement, which, if the merger is approved, would allow workers at Activision Blizzard to freely and fairly make a choice about union representation. The fact that workers’ concerns entered the acquisition conversation is in no small part thanks to the new antitrust emphasis on labor markets championed by the Biden administration. Although the terms of our agreement only apply to Activision Blizzard employees after Microsoft closes its acquisition, Microsoft executives made good on those principles for their own employees earlier this year. When quality assurance testers at the company’s Zenimax studio expressed interest in joining CWA, they were allowed to choose for themselves whether to join. No one was fired in retaliation for union activity. No one was forced to attend mandatory meetings and listen to union-busting pitches. The process was simple, free, and fair, the way it should be. Sadly, Microsoft stands alone among major U.S. video game and tech companies. Sony’s U.S. workforce is in the same position as Activision Blizzard’s, left to struggle under weak labor laws that companies often ignore. At this year’s Game Developers Conference, a group of video game workers delivered a letter to Sony’s management asking the company to agree to allow its workers to organize free from retaliation and interference. The response? Silence. Collective bargaining plays a critical role in counterbalancing employer market power. It constitutes a structural change to the labor market wherever it happens, enabling workers to achieve needed improvements to their wages and working conditions through their combined bargaining power. Under FTC chair Lina Khan’s leadership, the Commission’s intention to examine labor market impacts of mergers is well known. The draft merger guidelines that were recently released by the FTC and the Department of Justice begin to formalize that intention. The global commitments Microsoft has made on the consumer front paired with its game-changing labor market commitments will not only prevent harm to consumers but will also give workers a seat at the table that antitrust policymakers had until recently long excluded them from and that our democracy once again demands."

2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/no-excuses-do-better/,TechCrunch,Monday.com shows it’s possible to post great results even in a slow market,"Monday.com is continuing its streak of quick growth following its IPO. In addition to reporting a 42% rise in its revenue for the second quarter of 2023, the cloud-based platform that lets users create apps narrowed its operating loss and net loss, and improved its cash generation. Investors seem to like the progress, with its stock up by nearly 15% this morning. Notably, however, Monday.com is enduring the same sort of slowdown in net retention growth that we are seeing at many software companies. As a reminder, software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies grow by selling their products to new customers and by selling more products to existing customers. Monday.com, which charges on a per-seat basis, is one such company. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Slower growth of net retention, a metric that includes existing customer churn and upsells, means it can be harder to increase your revenue and make it costlier to do so, as it is more expensive to sell to new customers than to juice existing accounts for more seats. The slowdown we’ve seen in net retention comes at a difficult time for many tech companies, looking to conserve cash while keeping growth warm. Startups, doubly so. So how did Monday.com delight investors while also seeing its net retention moderate? Let’s find out. Monday.com reported revenue of $175.7 million in Q2 2023, but narrowed its operating loss to $12.2 million from $46.2 million a year ago. The company also managed to dramatically narrow its net loss to $0.15 per share from $1.01 per share. Excluding one-time costs, Monday.com reported adjusted operating income of $16.6 million, far better than $15.4 million a year earlier. The company also made impressive strides in improving its cash flows. In the company’s own words: "

In a regulatory filing, SecureWorks said that it would incur about $14.2 million in expenses due to the layoffs, mostly related to employee termination benefits and real-estate costs. SecureWorks chief executive Wendy Thomas cited the need to “simplify and scale our business and to deliver profitable growth” in an all-hands company email to employees justifying the cuts. The company announced an earlier 9% workforce reduction in February, as it aimed to prioritize its higher margin Tageis cloud security products. The company said in a filing at the time it had 2,149 full-time employees globally. That puts the number of affected employees at around 300 for this round of layoffs. SecureWorks said the departing employees’ last day will be August 25. SecureWorks is the latest company to announce layoffs this month alone. Cybersecurity giant Rapid7 said last week that it would lay off more than 400 employees as losses mount, and U.K.-based NCC Group announced it would make more layoffs just months after laying off 7% of its workforce."
2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/telegram-rolls-out-its-stories-feature-to-all-users/,TechCrunch,Telegram rolls out its Stories feature to all users,"Telegram is officially rolling out Stories to all users, the company announced on Monday. The feature first launched to Premium users last month, and is now available to everyone on the platform. Today’s announcement comes as Telegram is celebrating its 10th birthday. One major factor that sets Telegram’s new feature apart from Stories on other platforms is the fact that users have the option to edit them after posting. On platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and TikTok, you don’t have the option to edit a Story once it’s live. If you want to change something, you have to delete the Story and then start again. Telegram is taking a different approach with its Stories feature. “For the first time in the history of social media, you can update any element of your story at any time – changing its visibility, caption, on-screen text, stickers or anything else – without having to delete and repost it from scratch,” Telegram wrote in a blog post. The rest of Telegram’s Stories experience is similar to those on other platforms. You can choose to have your Stories viewable by everyone, your contacts, a few selected contacts or a list of close friends. Stories will be placed in an expandable section at the top of your chat list. You can hide Stories posted by any contact by moving them to the “Hidden” list in your Contacts section instead of the main screen. Users can choose when their story expires. For instance, you can have it expire in six, 12, 24 or 48 hours. Or, you can permanently display Stories on your profile page in a way that’s similar to how Instagram lets you display Story highlights. In addition, you can add captions and links to your Stories. There’s also the option to tag other people in your Stories. Plus, you will be able to post photos and videos taken with the front and rear cameras simultaneously in a BeReal-like style. Although Stories are now available to all users and just not paid users, Telegram is still offering Premium users a perk when it comes to Stories. Premium users can enable a feature called Stealth Mode that erases their views from any stories they opened in the past five minutes, and hides what they view for the next 25 minutes. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov said back in June that users had been asking for Stories for years. The company was initially against adding Stories because they “are already everywhere,” but wanted to listen to its users, Durov had said at the time."

The tests will begin today in Canada and the U.K. with a “limited number” of Netflix subscribers who will be given the chance to test games on their TVs. In the coming weeks, those tests will expand to include PCs and Mac computers through Netflix.com via supported browsers. Two games will initially be available as a part of these tests, including “Oxenfree” from Night School Studio — the first games studio the streamer acquired back in 2021 — and Molehew’s Mining Adventure, a gem-mining arcade game. Image Credits: Netflix On TVs, the games can be played on select devices from Netflix’s initial partners, including Amazon Fire TV Streaming Media Players, Chromecast with Google TV, LG TVs, Nvidia Shield TV, Roku devices and TVs, Samsung Smart TVs, and Walmart ONN. Notably missing is Apple TV, which has a TV-based gaming strategy of its own via apps from its App Store. Netflix says more devices will be supported over time, but did not detail which ones would later be supported. The news of the tests follows last week’s launch of an iPhone game controller app that allowed games to be played on the TV. The launch suggested that testing would soon be underway. Today, Netflix confirms that’s the case, noting that it’s now officially introducing a controller “that we already have in our hands most of the day — our phones.” From the looks of things, the controller app scans a QR code displayed on the Netflix app on the TV to connect to the game. Image Credits: Netflix Meanwhile, games on PCs and Macs will be played with a keyboard and mouse. During the limited beta, Netflix aims to test its game-streaming tech and its controller and work to improve the user experience, it says. “By making games available on more devices, we hope to make games even easier to play for our members around the world,” wrote Netflix VP of Games, Mike Verdu, on the company blog. “While we’re still very early in our games journey, we’re excited to bring joy to members with games. We look forward to hearing feedback from our beta testers and sharing more as we continue on the road ahead,” he added. The streamer last fall had signaled its intentions to expand into cloud gaming, when Verdu told the audience at our TechCrunch Disrupt event that Netflix was exploring such an offering. He also noted the company would open a new gaming studio in Southern California, led by Chacko Sonny, the former executive producer on Overwatch at Blizzard Entertainment. Netflix, however, doesn’t see itself as competing in the same space as PlayStation on Xbox, Verdu explained at the time. “It’s a completely different business model. The hope is over time that it just becomes this very natural way to play games wherever you are,” he noted. The streamer has 40 total games slated for launch this year, as well as 16 being developed in its in-house studios plus 70 more in development with its partners. Since Netflix expanded into gaming in November 2021, it has released 70 titles on mobile."
2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/fords-hands-off-driving-tech-available-by-subscription/,TechCrunch,Ford’s hands-off driving tech only available by subscription,"Ford shared on Monday that it’s heading deeper into the software game by making its hands-free driving hardware — BlueCruise — standard in many of its future vehicles. In other words, the Detroit automaker’s Tesla-ification continues.  Excluding the Mustang Mach-E, Ford had previously only given folks the option to buy the hands-off driving feature ahead of time, with the purchase of a new vehicle. Moving forward, Ford says it will build the requisite hands-free tech into “500,000 vehicles for the 2024 model year in North America across Ford and Lincoln,” including the F-150 Lightning, F-150, Expedition, Lincoln Navigator and Nautilus. Ford first indicated it was headed in this direction back in May. The upside is that car buyers won’t need to decide ahead of time if they want to try out BlueCruise. That could prove especially handy for used-car shoppers, who might want to shell out for features that previous owners weren’t interested in. The downside is this particular feature ain’t cheap. If you pay for access upfront with a new vehicle, Ford says it’ll charge you “$2,100 for three years at time of order.” Otherwise, the company will offer free trials before charging $800 per year or $75 per month. The offering sounds a whole lot like Tesla’s driver-assist subscriptions. Still, while Ford is late to the game, its subscription is at least a bit cheaper."
2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/researcher-says-they-were-behind-iphone-popups-at-def-con/,TechCrunch,Researcher says they were behind iPhone pop-ups at Def Con,"Several attendees at the hacking conference Def Con reported seeing mysterious and persistent pop-ups prompting them to use their Apple ID to connect to an Apple TV, or to share a password with an Apple TV nearby, according to attendee tweets over the weekend and people who spoke to TechCrunch. These incidents confused and dumbfounded some of the attendees, who weren’t sure how these alerts — for lack of a better word — were carried out, or what the goal was. Hacker shenanigans during Def Con are a decades-long tradition, and are more often pranks than actual malicious attacks. In this case, it may have just been a research project. On Saturday, a security researcher who goes by Jae Bochs said on Mastodon that it was them who was behind these activities. “I’ll come clean: it me,” Bochs wrote.  Bochs said the alerts they sent out were built with two purposes: to remind people to “really shut off Bluetooth,” and not just from the Control Center, and “to have a laugh.” Bochs said that this experiment wasn’t designed to collect any data, but rather to send Bluetooth “advertisement packets that don’t require pairing (and as such aren’t stopped by the control center toggle).” It’s unclear, however, if they — or someone else researching this feature — could have actually collected data and done something more malicious. The researcher said that to stop these pop-ups someone needs to turn off Bluetooth via the Settings app, not from the Control Center, which users can invoke by swiping down from the top right corner of the iPhone. TechCrunch spoke to eight attendees who said they saw one or both of the prompts while at the conference. Some of them saw the pop-ups several times over the weekend, and at different places around the conference floor. Opinions on the merits of this research project, which was not publicized in advance, varied. “I think it’s hilarious. It was annoying as hell but also reminded me that control center is bad 😂,” said NinjaLikesCheez, an iOS application security researcher who saw the pop-ups. Dan Guido, the CEO of security research firm Trail of Bits, wasn’t amused. “I think he abused a bunch of users when he should take his complaints to Apple,” Guido told TechCrunch. In response to someone who praised the experiment as “some OG #DEFCON shenanigans,” Bochs wrote that was the “vibe” they were hoping for. “Glad I could add a little harmless WTF to everyone’s day,” they wrote on Mastodon. The common denominator, at least for the people who spoke to TechCrunch, is that none of them had turned on Lockdown Mode, a special iPhone feature that limits some functionalities with the goal of reducing the risk of getting hacked. This reporter was using Lockdown Mode and never saw either of these prompts. Bochs said they were hoping to submit a talk based on this experiment, and to “have it working” with the upcoming iOS 17 feature called “NameDrop.” This new feature will allow iPhone owners to share their contact with someone else with an iPhone or Apple Watch by simply bringing the phones close to each other. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. When asked whether the conference organizers had seen these pop-ups themselves or whether they had been reported to them by attendees, Def Con spokesperson Melanie Ensign simply sent a link to Bochs’ Mastodon post. Do you have information about these alerts and how this iPhone feature works and whether it can be abused for a malicious attack? We’d love to hear from you.

2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/brex-expands-into-group-events-while-mesh-payments-moves-into-travel/,TechCrunch,Brex expands into group events while Mesh Payments moves into travel,"As the spend management space continues to get more competitive, the various players seem to be constantly iterating to add new features to their products. Today, fintech startup Brex announced it is moving in an unexpected direction with its travel offering while Mesh Payments said it’s expanding into travel in addition to general expense management. Let’s start with Brex. Specifically, the company announced a new group events feature, designed to help companies book and manage events, including offsites. It may feel like a big departure for a startup that started out focused on credit cards, but Brex VP of product Vineet Taneja said that it happened more naturally than you might expect.  When Brex began offering travel expense management to its customers earlier this year, the company noticed a pattern in looking at clients’ budgets. With more people working remotely either part or full-time, it appeared that more managers were holding offsite meetings in an effort to “help their teams make meaningful connections.” “We saw a 3x jump in the [number of] offsites companies are organizing,” he told TechCrunch in an interview. “We realized something was happening so we sat with about 20 travel managers and asked them ‘What do you do when an offsite comes up?’ And we realized, it’s a mess.” The new group events feature, Brex said, gives admins a way to not only manage travel needs but also to monitor events such as offsites, conferences as well as both internal events and external ones for their customers. For example, if a company sends 100 employees to a conference or trade show, the feature could be used by an admin to organize the travel, lodging, budgets, shuttle, etc. for all the employees attending that conference.  And because it’s integrated into Brex’s overall product, attendees can manage their travel using the company’s software and use its card for expenses. To be clear, Brex is not entering the events management space. It’s really more about helping its customers save time and money by aiding with the organizational logistics of the event. The company won’t be helping customers hire vendors such as caterers or bands, for example. Since launching its travel product, Taneja said that Brex has seen 20% to 25% month-over-month in travel booking. Customers who used the new events feature while in beta include GoGuardian and SeatGeek, among others. Image Credits: Brex Meanwhile, Mesh Payments today announced that it is entering the travel expense space. Mesh built the technology in-house over the last six months, according to CEO and co-founder Oded Zehavi.  “Our system is built to work with any TMC, we can work with any travel management company so that companies can use different TMCs for different regions or entities if they prefer,” he told TechCrunch via email. “We’re not locked into one TMC as some platforms.” Also, other companies have chosen to work with existing providers. Brex, for example, partnered with a company called Spotnana in building out its new travel offering, essentially white-labeling its “travel-as-a-service” software, which provides back-end infrastructure that integrates with global airlines and hotels.  Mesh says its new product includes AI-enabled travel and expense spend management with chat-based user experiences designed to streamline workflows. AI is a common feature in spend management companies’ offerings, with many of them, such as Navan, Ramp, Brex and Rho claiming to offer AI-powered or enabled features. Zehavi said the expansion to travel management was an organic one for Mesh.  “We listened to our multinational customers as they navigated the complexities of corporate travel,” he said. The startup joins competitors such as Brex and Ramp, who have expanded into travel in recent years. It also wants to go head-to-head with companies such as Navan, who first started out in travel expense management before moving into helping companies manage their expenses more broadly.

2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/robomart-is-banking-on-store-hailing-to-bring-self-driving-stores-directly-to-customers/,TechCrunch,Robomart is banking on ‘store-hailing’ to bring self-driving stores directly to customers,"The last few years have dramatically disrupted the way many people get their food. What started as a safety precaution has become an everyday occurrence for many, as people are skipping restaurant waits and grocery store lines for the convenience of apps like Instacart and Seamless. Of course, the apps have their own drawbacks. When it comes to buying things from the supermarket or drugstores, websites can be difficult to navigate and rarely offer an accurate representation of what’s actually in stock at a given time. That leads to mistakes, unfulfilled orders and general frustration. Robomart, which we first covered at the beginning of 2018, was built around the premise of “store-hailing.” It’s pretty much what it sounds like: Instead of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, it brings a small cross section of a store directly to consumers by way of a small, stocked-up, self-driving vehicle. Today the Los Angeles–based firm is announcing a $2 million seed round, putting its to-date funding at $3.4 million. Backers include Wasabi Ventures, SOSV/HAX and Hustle Fund. W Ventures led this round. Want the top robotics news in your inbox each week? Sign up for Actuator here. The funding news comes alongside a product reveal. The Haven joins the company’s existing Oasis model. It offers retailers customized branding options (effectively a car wrap) and capacity for ~300 SKUs. “Robomart Haven gives supermarkets the ability to expand their retail footprint at a fraction of the cost,” co-founder and CEO Ali Ahmed says. “Leveraging our powerful white label suite of software, they can enable store-hailing under their own retail banner by providing consumers with a full in-person shopping experience for all their daily essentials right at home.” The Oasis is primarily targeted at restaurants, counting Ben & Jerry’s among its existing customers. The vehicle — which is more akin to a customized minivan than a Nuro-style self-driving cart — launched in beta at the end of 2020. The timing couldn’t have been better for a startup designed to bring food and supplies to people. Around 100 of the vehicles have been contracted out. Haven, which is set to start delivering in 2025, is focused on supermarkets and convenience stores."
2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/web3-gaming-adoption-is-skewing-towards-asia-and-the-rest-of-the-world-may-have-to-play-catch-up/,TechCrunch,"Web3 gaming adoption is skewing toward Asia, and the rest of the world may have to play catch-up","Culture is often inseparable from entertainment. Your affinity for the kind of books, music, film or art you consume has more to do with the language you speak, the values your family and friends espouse, and the economics of where you live than anything else. You could argue that those preferences are even stronger when it comes to gaming, since it offers a level of interactivity that engages you more than most other forms of entertainment. So it makes sense that cultural differences between Asia and the Western world are affecting how the web3 gaming market is developing. According to Robbie Ferguson, president and co-founder of web3 gaming company Immutable, gaming companies in Asia are on the frontlines of web3 gaming development due to the “very strong genre-fit” between web3 gaming and a lot of the existing popular games in Asia that are already highly driven by collectibles. “[Asian gaming developers] ushered in mobile gaming; they were at the advent of free-to-play and that means they actually say, ‘This is a way to disrupt and sort of stay at the front,’” Ferguson recently said on the TechCrunch Chain Reaction podcast. He added that the popularity of collectibles in existing mainstream titles in the region would align well with NFTs in web3 games. And that genre-fit is causing the development of this niche of the crypto industry to be skewed toward Asia these days. “It’s a little bit bifurcated,” Ferguson said. “I think the consumer response is probably different right now between the West and between Asia. There’s a lot of tailwind in Asia, but the Western countries are not as eager to dive in.” Ferguson and his company have bet extensively on the crypto gaming market. Immutable offers developers a platform for building and scaling Ethereum-based web3 games via its aptly named subsidiary Immutable Platform, and the company develops and publishes web3 games via another arm called Immutable Games. The platform has attracted some traditional gaming studios and IP holders such as GameStop, TikTok, Illuvium and NFT marketplace OpenSea to build games, too. In March 2022, Immutable raised $200 million at a $2.5 billion valuation, and last June it launched a $500 million developer and venture investment fund. Those bets may come good. In late July, Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida said at the WebX conference in Tokyo that “web3 is part of the new form of capitalism.” Although he wasn’t talking specifically about web3 gaming, in 2022, Kishida said his government will promote and invest in web3 services like NFTs and the metaverse.

2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/nikola-shares-tank-after-ev-maker-recalls-its-battery-electric-big-rigs/,TechCrunch,Nikola shares tank after EV maker recalls its battery-electric big rigs,"Electric truck maker Nikola shares plummeted Monday after it recalled nearly all of its battery electric semi trucks. The company recalled 209 of its Class 8 Tre battery electric vehicles after a third-party investigation found a coolant leak likely caused a battery fire in one of its trucks. The company said Friday it has placed a temporary hold on new BEV sales until a resolution is in place. Nikola’s stock fell around 20% Monday shortly after the start of regular trading. That’s a tough hit after the company announced the departure of its CEO and president last week alongside disappointing earnings. Nikola reported a 15% drop in revenue and a nearly 26% increase in losses from the same period last year. Nikola had previously suspected foul play as the cause of a battery fire on June 23 outside the company’s headquarters in Phoenix. Video footage showed a vehicle parked next to the impacted trucks and pulling away after a bright flash and the start of the fire. After internal investigations and a probe from a third-party investigator, Nikola has ruled out foul play and other external factors. The preliminary findings from Exponent found a coolant leak inside a single battery pack to be the probable cause of the truck fire at the company’s headquarters. Those findings were further corroborated by a minor thermal incident in another pack on an engineering validation truck parked at Nikola’s Coolidge plant on August 10. The company said no one was injured in either incident. Out of the more than 3,100 packs on trucks produced to date, those were the only two thermal incidents to occur.  Nikola’s internal investigations found a single supplier component within the battery pack to be the source of the coolant leak. The company says it will provide a field remedy in the coming weeks. While owners of Nikola’s BEV trucks may keep them in operation, the company suggests customers and dealers place the Main Battery Disconnect (MBD) switch to the “ON” position at all times to allow for real-time vehicle monitoring and safety systems operations. Nikola also encourages customers to consider parking their trucks outside to allow for over-the-air updates and better connectivity to Nikola’s truck monitoring system. Nikola said the recalls do not affect the hydrogen fuel cell EVs currently in production, which have a different battery pack design. Nikola has experienced a string of scandals and internal dramas over the past several years, largely due to its controversial and since ousted founder Trevor Milton, who was charged with wire and securities fraud. Last week, the company successfully received enough shareholder support to issue more shares, a move that would allow it to potentially raise more capital."
2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/ford-taps-apple-exec-to-lead-new-software-services-unit/,TechCrunch,Ford taps Apple exec to lead new software services unit,"Ford has hired Peter Stern, a former executive at Apple, to lead its newly formed Ford Integrated Services unit. The unit will create and market software-enabled customer experiences across Ford’s three business units: Ford Blue, for gas and hybrid vehicles, Model e for connected EVs, and Ford Pro for commercial products. As the era of the software-defined vehicle takes hold, Ford is actively building out more services to personalize the driver experience, connect hardware and software and bring in new revenue streams. While Ford generated $45 billion in revenue in the second quarter, the automaker expects its EV business to lose $4.5 billion in 2023. The company is betting on software to help close that gap. Ford Integrated Services will be responsible for further developing technology like Ford’s BlueCruise “hands-free” highway driver assistance system, which is currently priced at $2,100. The new unit will also focus on commercial solutions for fleet management, telematics and EV charging. Ford says it already has 550,000 paid software and services subscribers, with 80% of those customers coming from Ford Pro. Stern will also oversee Ford Next, the automaker’s global venture studio, according to the automaker. Ford Next’s CEO, Franck Louis-Victor, was arrested in July on felony charges of arson and assault with a deadly weapon after a domestic dispute at his home. The charges were dismissed, but Louis-Victor no longer appears to be working at Ford. Ford says he in on leave. Louis-Victor previously oversaw a unit dedicated to technology-forward customer experiences. “This is transformational, because the cornerstone of our Ford+ plan is creating incredible customer services and experiences enabled by great hardware and software,” CEO and president Jim Farley said in a statement. “There’s simply no one in the world better able than Peter Stern to build this strategically vital part of our business.”"
2023-08-14,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/millions-americans-health-data-moveit-hackers-clop-ibm/,TechCrunch,Millions of Americans’ health data stolen after MOVEit hackers targeted IBM,"Millions of Americans had their sensitive medical and health information stolen after hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the widely used MOVEit file transfer software raided systems operated by tech giant IBM. The Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (HCPF), which is responsible for administering Colorado’s Medicaid program, confirmed on Friday that it had fallen victim to the MOVEit mass hacks, exposing the data of more than 4 million patients. In a data breach notification to those affected, Colorado’s HCPF said that the data was compromised because IBM, one of the state’s vendors, “uses the MOVEit application to move HCPF data files in the normal course of business.” The letter states that while no HCPF or Colorado state government systems were affected by this issue, “certain HCPF files on the MOVEit application used by IBM were accessed by the unauthorized actor.” These files include patients’ full names, dates of birth, home addresses, Social Security numbers, Medicaid and Medicare ID numbers, income information, clinical and medical data (including lab results and medication), and health insurance information. HCPF says about 4.1 million individuals are affected. IBM has yet to publicly confirm that it was affected by the MOVEit mass hacks, and an IBM spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. The breach of IBM’s MOVEit systems also impacted Missouri’s Department of Social Services (DSS), though the number of affected individuals is not yet known. More than 6 million people live in Missouri state. In a data breach notification posted last week, Missouri’s DSS said: “IBM is a vendor that provides services to DSS, the state agency that provides Medicaid services to eligible Missourians. The data vulnerability did not directly impact any DSS systems, but impacted data belonging to DSS.” DSS says that the data accessed may include an individual’s name, department client number, date of birth, possible benefit eligibility status or coverage, and medical claims information. Neither Colorado’s HCPF nor Missouri’s DSS have been listed on the dark web leak site of the Clop ransomware gang, which has claimed responsibility for the mass hacks. In a message on the site, the Russia-linked group claims, “We don’t have any government data.” The news of Colorado’s latest breach comes just days after the Colorado Department of Higher Education said it had experienced a ransomware incident that saw hackers access and copy 16 years’ worth of data from its systems. Colorado State University also confirmed last month that it had suffered a MOVEit-related data breach impacting tens of thousands of students and academic staff. Meanwhile, PH Tech, a company that provides data management services to U.S. healthcare insurers, confirmed that it was also impacted by the MOVEit hacks, affecting the health information of 1.7 million Oregon residents. The largest breach of a U.S. healthcare provider so far this year goes to HCA Healthcare, which involved the names, addresses and appointment details of 11.2 million people in a security lapse unrelated to MOVEit."
2023-08-13,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/13/smart-rings-india/,TechCrunch,"India, the world’s largest smartwatch market, is getting new smart rings","The world’s largest smartwatch market is about to get two new smart rings. While wrist-worn wearables are still wildly popular in India, a pair of domestic manufacturers are banking on consumers who are meticulous about health and sleep tracking but are less interested in the form factor. BoAt and Noise are entering the smart ring market after putting up a tough fight against Apple, Samsung and Huawei with affordable wearables. The pair also frequently ranks among the top five manufacturers of wearable devices on the global charts. Last month, both companies announced plans to launch smart rings in India, though the devices have yet to hit shelves. First, BoAt and Noise need to determine demand, but both are optimistic. In the third quarter of 2022, the South Asian nation became the world’s largest smartwatch market, with 167% year-on-year growth, according to market research firm Counterpoint. India also recently surpassed the U.S. and China per IDC. A recent report by the firm shows the country saw a 37.2% year-on-year growth in the overall wearable market, with 32.8 million wearables shipped in the second quarter of 2023. India’s smartwatch shipments almost doubled to 12.8 million in the quarter, whereas earbuds saw a 15.2% year-on-year growth. While traditional players like Apple and Samsung have seen increased shipments of their wearables in India in the last few months as the country saw a notable growth in premium smartphones, the market is primarily driven by local players, including BoAt and bootstrapped Noise. The primary reason for the continuous success of local companies is their focus on launching ultra-affordable, sub-$30 smartwatches and wireless earbuds that offer a look and feel similar to high-end devices. IDC said the country’s average selling price (ASP) of smartwatches declined by 44.9% to $25.6 from $46.6 in the second quarter. Further, the wearable ASP, in general, dropped to $21 from $26.7 a year ago. BoAt and Noise are the two dominant wearable makers in the country per IDC, with a market share of 26.6% and 13.5% in the second quarter, respectively. Chinese smartphone maker Oppo (which includes OnePlus), followed the Indian players in the wearable market with a share of 10.7%. Top 5 wearable companies in India in Q2 2023. Image Credits: IDC Low-cost devices have accelerated sales, but there are trade-offs. Still, the vendors are looking to offer as much functionality as possible at the low price point. However, smart rings have thus far failed to drum up the same interest. While the smart ring market in the U.S. has startups such as Oura, India has Ultrahuman and Pi Ring as two of the early players. However, the arrival of BoAt and Noise may accelerate consumer interest and adoption. “This move is likely to inspire other wearable brands to enter this category, leading to increased variety and choices for consumers,” Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India, told TechCrunch. He added that there is a significant untapped potential for traditional wearable form factors, as well as new ones like smart rings. Like their competitors, BoAt and Noise both promise precise health and sleep tracking through their smart rings. However, they each have their target customer base. BoAt’s CEO and managing director, Sameer Mehta, told TechCrunch that the startup — which started working on its smart ring in November — is targeting customers who are not first-time smartwatch users but rather those on their second- or third-generation smartwatches. For Noise, co-founder Amit Khatri said it looks at consumers who want accurate health and sleep tracking but don’t want to move from an analog watch. The startup has been working on the device for over a year. Tech giants such as Apple, Samsung and Huawei have long focused on the wrist. It’s not the most comfortable option for everyone, and it can be challenging to maintain precise tracking through the wrist. Ensuring that your smartwatch fits snugly to obtain accurate data is crucial. A smart ring can be the great solution, however, provided you have the right size. A finger has access to arteries, which a smartwatch could not reach, Mohit Kumar, founder and CEO of Ultrahuman, which counts iSeed, Steadview, Nexus Venture Partners and Blume among its key investors, told TechCrunch. “If you go to any medical grade pulse oximetry devices, you put it on your finger. You don’t put it on your wrist. That’s primarily because this is a much better source of data,” he said. Khatri of Noise agreed with Kumar and said the data available through a finger is way higher than a device can get from a smartwatch. However, the ring needs to have high-end sensors paired with precise algorithms to provide effectively accurate results. Fitting the sensors that are typically available in a smartwatch in a ring is a challenge for manufacturers. The other key challenge in smart rings is ensuring that they fit perfectly. A minuscule gap can alter the data these devices get from the finger. Smart ring makers have created a sizing kit with a few average finger sizes they send customers to ensure the size is perfect. And for manufacturing, BoAt and Noise have chosen third-party manufacturers. Khatri told TechCrunch Noise did the R&D of its smart ring, Luna Ring, from scratch. The startup has its vertical named Noise Labs for experimenting with different form factors, including smart eyewear. “We have identified manufacturers who are doing it for the world’s best,” he said while answering the question about the Noise’s smart ring manufacturer. Noise’s smart ring has been in the works for over a year. Image Credits: Noise BoAt’s Mehta told TechCrunch that the startup selected a manufacturer in China to produce 5,000 units initially. Unlike BoAt and Noise, Ultrahuman produces smart rings at its facility in India. Kumar said the startup evaluated the option of going with an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) route but decided to set up its native production to have complete control over hardware and software. “There are many, many OEMs available,” he said. “Most of these folks expect a certain volume, and they give you some firmware access but not 100% unless, of course, you have to deploy billions of dollars in capital.” Ultrahuman sells its smart rings to the Middle East and London, alongside India. Kumar said India remains the dominant market, accounting for 9,000 monthly shipments out of the total 12,000 units that are shipped across markets. “India is still a larger one,” he said. “That’s probably because our distribution is in India; we initially launched in India.” Ultrahuman has identified a potential customer base of 500,000 to 1 million individuals in India, and this number is continually growing, the founder said. Although data accuracy is essential in smart rings to retain customers, pricing is also vital to reach a broader customer base. Ultrahuman currently sells its smart ring, called the Ring Air, for $349, while BoAt is looking to bring its offering with a price tag of sub-$80. Noise has yet to reveal the price of its Luna Ring, though co-founder Khatri told TechCrunch that it was looking at a “premium” segment this time. In the U.S., companies including Oura have a subscription-based model where customers pay a separate amount regularly to access health and sleep tracking with their smart ring. Oura received criticism from customers after moving key metrics behind a monthly subscription paywall, even though it was already charging a substantial amount for the device. Indian players believe such a model does not work in the country. Kumar of Ultrahuman admitted that the pricing of its smart ring is quite premium at the moment, and the startup was “trying a lot” to make it affordable. “The only constraint that we have is that we need to have medical grade accuracy of the data,” he said. Ultrahuman considers India to have “extremely value-conscious” customers. So, it wants to maintain its value while keeping the price high — higher than what is expected to be available through the new players. Ultrahuman Ring Air is priced at $349. Image Credits: Ultrahuman “There are two strategies: One is to sell to a mass and forget about customer feedback because you’re always selling to more people, or you sell to a niche, and you become more value-driven,” the founder stated. Ultrahuman’s smart ring uses medical-grade sensors along with tungsten carbide–coated titanium. Over time, the startup plans to introduce a Flexi Pay Plan, allowing customers to pay $25 monthly instead of the entire amount upfront. However, it still does not want to go with a subscription model. “Subscription is a flawed model in this product specifically. Many companies in the U.S. are charging a fixed fee plus $8 a month. For the consumer, that’s extremely unfriendly because the hardware is not the same after a few months, so why will you need to pay the same amount?” Kumar said. Ultrahuman also sells its arm-mounted continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The device was originally designed for individuals with diabetes or pre-diabetes to keep track of their blood glucose levels. However, the startup has introduced an integration between its CGM and smart ring by claiming to offer “deep correlations and predictive insights” through pairing the two. Kumar told TechCrunch almost 35% of people who buy the ring also end up using the CGM. Like Ultrahuman, BoAt and Noise are currently not looking to introduce a subscription-based model for their smart rings. “Software-as-a-service (SaaS) doesn’t work in India. Even the likes of Netflix are struggling to have a subscription base, and entertainment is one of the biggest drivers in the country,” said Mehta of BoAt. In the future, BoAt envisions the possibility of introducing a “recharge model.” This approach would allow users of its smart ring to access services by paying a nominal fee at regular intervals. Oura declined to comment on plans for India. India saw 100 million wearables shipped during 2022, according to IDC. Significant contributions came from affordable wearables from Indian players, including BoAt, Noise and Fire-Boltt. The trend is expected to remain the same this year. “The increasing consumer demand for smart wearables as fitness trackers and lifestyle accessories has been a driving force behind the market expansion,” said IDC’s Singh. Launching smart rings from BoAt and Noise is expected to bring competition to this nascent space. “Smart rings offer the same health and fitness tracking capabilities without needing an external screen or occupying a real estate like wrist or ear, making them more compact and fitting seamlessly into the user’s fashion choices, providing added convenience,” Singh adds. Kumar told TechCrunch that the new players would help increase adoption among offline retailers in the country. “If you go to an offline retailer today and say I am selling a smart ring, they say, ‘What do you mean?'” he said. BoAt and Noise will start selling their smart rings online, though both plan to bring them through offline channels soon. BoAt has teased the launch of its smart ring in India. Image Credits: BoAt Kumar also believes the new competitors would practically take some of Ultrahuman’s potential customers. “If we end up delivering more value on both hardware and software and, basically, a better experience. Of course, most people will migrate to us eventually,” he said. Recent reports suggest that Apple and Samsung are also exploring possibilities to enter the smart ring market. However, both giants have yet to release their official details. Noise’s Khatri said it would take some time for the established players to enter the market. “We are very nimble. We will fail fast . . . we can experiment faster as a startup,” he said. “For any bigger organization to launch a product, it’s a different ball game altogether.” Nevertheless, introducing smart rings by these Indian players expands the range of accessible and affordable choices for consumers, offering alternatives until industry giants like Apple or Samsung eventually bring comparable offerings."
2023-08-13,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/13/the-space-industry-is-starting-a-green-revolution/,TechCrunch,The space industry is starting a green revolution,"Rocket launches are nothing short of spectacular. Whether we grew up in the Apollo era, the space shuttle era or the private space era, most of us can easily bring to mind a rocket launch with the roar of its engines, jets of fire and trails of smoke. That image is burned into the consciousness of nearly everyone on planet Earth with access to TV or internet. But, until recently, few people considered that those spectacular launches might be leaving an awful lot of pollution in its wake. As it turns out, the space travel industry, with its several dozen launches per year, is responsible for the same amount of carbon emissions as the global aviation industry. With the commercial space industry maturing at a rapid pace, we are seeing a steady increase in the number of rocket launches every year. So, the scale of the problem is only going to grow.

			The space travel industry is responsible for the same amount of carbon emissions as the global aviation industry.

 In May 2022, two scientists from the University of Nicosia in Cyprus, Ioannis Kokkinakis and Dimitris Drikakis, sought to quantify the potential impact in a study that appeared in the Physics of Fluids journal. They sought to measure the potential health and climate risks by blending rocket launch data with computer simulations. The conclusion they reached was that “pollution from rockets should not be underestimated as frequent future rocket launches could have a significant cumulative effect on climate,” and may also become “hazardous to human health.” In the simulations, the scientists used data based on the standard rocket fuel RP-1. And therein lies one of the biggest problems that the space launch industry needs to tackle. RP-1 (alternatively, Rocket Propellant-1 or Refined Petroleum-1) is a highly refined form of kerosene that has been the standard rocket fuel used for decades. Unfortunately, RP-1 is not and never has been a clean-burning fuel. A launch using RP-1 or similar kerosene-based fuel creates many tons of CO2, as well as particulates in the atmosphere called black carbon, commonly known as soot. However, it is not all doom and gloom. It is early days, admittedly, but it is safe to say there is a green revolution starting in the space launch industry. Positive signs are starting to appear across the global space industry and it appears to be gathering steam. It is starting with a rethink about the fuels that are being utilized. Three emerging rocket launch companies, two in Europe and one in the U.S., have decided to build their rockets around a very different, yet very familiar fuel — propane. Strange as it may seem, what most people think of as camping gas might be a saving grace for the global space launch industry. Propane has qualities that make it a very sustainable fuel. First, it is very clean-burning, meaning that black carbon is not left in the atmosphere. Second, its carbon footprint is minimal compared to RP-1. A study from the University of Exeter concluded that a “microlauncher” rocket using the renewable form of propane — bio-propane — could reduce CO2 emissions by up to 96% compared to other similarly sized rockets. One spaceport currently being built in Scotland, Sutherland Spaceport, is also taking a stand on environmental sustainability. The developers of that spaceport aim to make it the first carbon-neutral spaceport globally — both in its construction and its operation. One illustration of what that means practically is how the developers plan to reuse the peat lifted from the construction to repair the peat “scars” in the landscape nearby, created by decades of harvesting peat for fuel. Another hopeful sign from the space industry comes from the European Space Agency (ESA). They recently commissioned a study called “Ultra-Green Launch & Space Transportation Systems.” Although this is a long-term play, as it is looking for solutions to be exploited in the period 2030–2050, the fact that a major space agency is studying the issue is a positive sign of the direction that the global space industry in taking. There is positive momentum, too, from the European Space Agency, through their leadership in tackling the issue of space debris or space junk. Anyone who has seen the movie Wall-E can picture what that might look like from space and feel a little collective shame at how humanity has reached this situation. It is thought that there are now millions of fragments of space junk in Earth’s orbit. However, one of the most comforting aspects of ESA’s leadership in this sphere is how they are actively putting resources into projects that will seek to actively remove debris, leaving our planet’s orbit cleaner and more accessible. Five to ten years ago, you would have struggled to find anyone, anywhere connecting the words “sustainability” and “space.” That is changing, and rightly so. But this is not the time to sit back and think that everything will be fine. If the space industry is to flourish in the 21st-century, sustainability will need to become a core part of its ethos. What may begin with polite applause from the periphery for sustainability initiatives will no doubt lead to financial disincentives and eventually legislation. Even if most people are excited and inspired by rocket launches, the space industry is unlikely to get a free pass for much longer."

2023-08-13,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/13/moovit-transportation-app-moovit-hackers-free-rides/,TechCrunch,Bugs in transportation app Moovit gave hackers free rides,"Hackers could have hijacked the user accounts of a popular transportation app and used them to get free rides and access people’s personal information, according to a security researcher. Omer Attias, a security researcher at SafeBreach, said he found three vulnerabilities in the Moovit app that allowed him to collect new Moovit user’s registration information from all over the world — including cell phone numbers, email addresses, home addresses, and the last four digits of credit cards. Worst of all, the bugs could have allowed him to take over other people’s accounts, and consequently their credit cards, to pay for his own rides. This whole chain of exploits could have been performed without the target ever finding out, apart from seeing unwanted charges on their credit card. Attias called it “the perfect attack.” “We can fully impersonate accounts, without disconnecting them. It’s crazy, we actually have the ability to perform all the operations on behalf of different accounts, including ordering train tickets,” Attias told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of his talk at the Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas. “And additionally, we can access all of their personal information.” To demonstrate the impact of the bugs he found, Attias created a custom interface that allowed him to take over other people’s accounts with a couple of taps. And while Attias said he tested his exploits only in Israel, he said he thinks it could have worked in other cities given that Moovit operates all over the world. Moovit is an Israeli startup that was acquired by Intel in 2020 for $900 million. The app allows users to find routes and view public transportation systems’ maps, as well as to purchase and use tickets. The app and its underlying technology are widely used worldwide: Moovit claims to serve 1.7 billion riders in 3,500 cities across 112 countries. While the impact of these vulnerabilities was potentially massive, Moovit said there is no evidence that malicious hackers found and exploited these bugs. Attias said that he reported all the bugs he found to the company in September 2022, and the company subsequently fixed them. “Moovit was aware of and rectifying the issue when it was reported, and took immediate steps to finish correcting the issue,” Moovit spokesperson Sharon Kaslassi told TechCrunch. “The vulnerabilities have long since been fixed and no customer action is required. It’s important to note that no bad actors took advantage of these issues to access customer data. Additionally, no credit card information was exposed as Moovit and Moovit-Pango do not keep credit card information on file.” Kaslassi also said that “ticketing service relevant to these findings is active in Israel only.” “According to our records, neither Safebreach nor anyone else took advantage of any customer data in or outside of Israel,” the spokesperson added. In response to Moovit’s comments, Attias said that he and his colleagues “believe we could have charged any customer not limited to Israeli customers. We haven’t seen any differentiator between Israeli and non-Israeli customers in their API requests.” Read more from Black Hat:"

All eyes were on San Francisco this week as critics and supporters of deploying self-driving cars on public roads awaited a vote from the California Public Utilities Commission. Tl;dr: it was a win for the autonomous vehicle industry. If you haven’t been following, the CPUC approved the last remaining permits to Cruise and Waymo, giving the two companies the green light to offer commercial robotaxi services across San Francisco 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In the lead up to the vote, the commission listened to hundreds of public comments, which were pretty evenly split for and against. My take: Cruise and Waymo may have won this battle, but the war to win over the public is hardly over. Want to reach out with a tip, comment or complaint?

You remember Veo, right? It’s the shared micromobility operator that has gained a rep for growing at a steady, sustainable pace, rather than moving fast and breaking things? Well, now the company is moving into the retail space<. Candice Xie, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that its Cosmo seated scooter was so popular, the company decided to pursue D2C sales of it. When a company adds a business unit, I wonder if it’s in trouble and looking for new ways to secure revenue. Xie says that Veo is still operating profitably and sees moving into retail as a good way to expand into new markets. The company is starting with limited sales this year and will grow its capacity in 2024 if all goes well. The Cosmo X starts at $3,499. In other news . . .  Bird has another new CEO. Not even a year after the struggling company fired its founder Travis VanderZanden and replaced him with Shane Torchiana, it appears the company is facing yet another executive shakeup. Torchiana is jumping ship (as many execs at Bird have already done), to be replaced by the company’s rather new CFO. Michael Washinushi has officially taken over as interim CEO. Boston mayor Michelle Wu is offering free cycling lessons for kids. London-based HumanForest is now just Forest. And it’s doubling its bike-share numbers in the English city. NABSA’s fourth annual state of shared micromobility report shows that ridership in North America has returned to pre-pandemic levels. The number of cities with shared micromobility has hit an all-time high with 401 cities, and shared e-bikes and e-scooters have offset about 74 million pounds of CO2 emissions by replacing auto trips. Tier and Voi are reportedly in talks over a merger. — Rebecca Bellan  The deal of the week took me by surprise! Serve Robotics, the autonomous sidewalk delivery robot startup that spun out of Uber’s acquisition of Postmates, is going public via a reverse merger with a blank-check company. Ahead of the merger, Serve raised $30 million in a round led by existing investors Uber, Nvidia and Wavemaker Partners. New investors Mark Tompkins and Republic Deal Room also participated. The startup/soon-to-be-public company has raised a total of $56 million. Upon the closing of the merger, Uber held a 16.2% stake and Nvidia an 11% stake in Serve, according to regulatory filings. Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s vice president of delivery and head of its Americas region, has joined Serve’s board. Other deals that got my attention this week . . .  Archer Aviation raised $215 million in new capital from its manufacturing partner Stellantis, Boeing, United Airlines, Ark Investment Management LLC and others, to accelerate its path to commercialization. Boeing’s portion of that new investment is going to support the collaboration between Wisk and Archer on autonomy, a source told TechCrunch. There was some other big Archer news this week as well that I suppose could be considered a deal, or at least an agreement. I’m talking about Archer Aviation and its rival Wisk settling their trade secret legal dispute more than two years after the lawsuit was originally filed. In a somewhat surprise twist — given how bitterly the legal battle had become — the two companies have agreed to collaborate, TechCrunch reported. Archer also agreed to make Wisk its exclusive provider of autonomy technology to be integrated into a future autonomous variant of Archer’s Midnight aircraft, in addition to the collaboration, according to a source familiar with the settlement. Inrix, the transportation analytics and connected car services, raised $70 million in a financing round from investment funds managed by Morgan Stanley Expansion Capital and Morgan Stanley Tactical Value. Proterra filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. I dug into Proterra’s day one declaration and while some parallels can be drawn between Proterra and other failing or defunct EV companies, this company faces specific headwinds that took it down a rocky financial path. I break down what led to Proterra’s bankruptcy. Treehouse, a home EV charging startup, raised $10 million in a funding round led by Montage Ventures and Trucks Venture Capital, with participation from CarMax, Assurant Ventures, Acrew Capital, Gutter Capital, Detroit Venture Partners, Holman and Automotive Ventures. Yellow, a Nashville-based trucking company, filed for bankruptcy and has plans to shutter. The company had received a $700 million loan from the Trump administration in 2020.  Cruise has started testing its self-driving vehicles in Atlanta. There were loads of earnings this week, but maybe you missed these two. Two-wheeler battery-swapping company Gogoro reported revenue of $87.2 million in Q2, down 3.8% YoY and up 0.2% on a constant currency basis. Of that revenue, $33.3 million came from its battery-swapping service, predominantly active in Taiwan, which is up 9.5% YoY. Gogoro recorded a net loss of just $5.6 million, which is way down from a net loss of $121.1 million last year, which was primarily due to a one-time $178.8 million listing expense for its SPAC merger in 2022. In adjusted terms, Gogoro recorded $12.9 million, which is up from $9.3 million in Q2 2022. Shared micromobility operator Bird recorded revenue of $48.3 million, down from the $66.8 million reported in Q2 2022. Bird says this is because it is operating in fewer markets than last year. That said, ride profit also went down to $26.6 million, compared to $28.4 million last year. Bird has been trying to bring down costs, and it seems to be working. The company recorded a net loss of $9.3 million in Q2 2023, compared to $320.3 million in the same period of 2022. But it might not be enough to keep the company afloat. Bird has just –$1.8 million in free cash flow, and its total operating expenses in Q2 were $36.1 million. Maybe the company’s new CEO will be able to turn the ship around. BrightDrop, GM’s commercial EV delivery business unit, plans to expand sales of its flagship electric vans to Mexico. Cadillac revealed the Escalade IQ — an absolutely massive EV, laden with screens, luxury features, an estimated 450 miles of range and the option to upgrade the automaker’s standard advanced driver assistance system, known as Super Cruise, to the next-level Ultra Cruise. Lucid said during its Q2 earnings call that it will reveal its long-awaited, all-electric Gravity SUV in November with production not kicking off until late 2024.  Motiv Power Systems said it plans to launch a medium-duty chassis with a cab that can be used in various sizes of box trucks, step vans, shuttle buses, refrigerated vehicles and vocational vehicles. Rivian gained positive momentum in the second quarter as it ramped up EV sales, narrowed losses, reduced costs and shored up its supply chain. The company also raised its production guidance for the year from 50,000 to 52,000 vehicles and said it expects its adjusted earnings guidance for the year to improve to a loss of $4.2 billion. While still a massive number, it is better than it expected. Arrival‘s board of directors appointed Igor Torgov as an executive director. Verge Motorcycles appointed Mark Wilson as its new CFO. Wilson was most recently CFO for Aston Martin Lagonda Plc and before that McLaren Automotive. Vroom vroom!

2023-08-13,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/13/is-ai-platform-or-market/,TechCrunch,"Sure AI is hot, but is it an actual market or a platform piece?","Companies of all stripes have begun embracing generative AI as a way to increase productivity and possibly even replace some workers. But the base technology has been around for decades. Over the last five to 10 years, big enterprise software companies have been building AI into their platforms without the same level of screaming hype we are seeing at the moment. The problem has always been placing AI. It hasn’t helped that there has been a tendency for the early adopters to personify and productize it, even if it wasn’t really a product. Salesforce called it Einstein; Adobe, Sensei; and IBM, Watson. But AI isn’t one thing you can nail down and call a product, per se. These companies aren’t necessarily selling AI like they would CRM or Photoshop or health records software. Instead they infused AI into different parts of the product line, making the products they sell potentially better. Since generative AI hit the scene at the end of last year with the release of GPT-4, the hype machine has been out of control. Suddenly, AI was in front of everyone in a way it never had been before. But even with the higher profile, it’s not clear this is an actual market, and it’s even less clear how many companies are truly embracing it in spite of all the ballyhoo. Clearly, though, companies are curious about what AI can do. Enterprise software vendors have been adding functionality and branding it to get the most juice out of their marketing. Startups have been popping up, too: Cohere, Anthropic, Writer and Jasper are among those trying to build businesses around generative AI technology, whether by building foundational models or tools to take advantage of generative AI in an enterprise setting. As we find ourselves in the midst of this AI-induced frenzy, it could be useful to take a step back and see just what we are dealing with here. Is there actually an AI market in the pure sense, or is it enabling technology that will soon be built into everything, making how we view it less clear? Sure, everyone is talking about AI, but what are Fortune 500 and 2000 companies actually doing when it comes to AI? It would appear that while clearly there is a lot of interest (to put it mildly), big companies are treading lightly, as large companies tend to do. "

For those new to WiR, think of it as a digest of stories and pieces that topped the charts over the past five days or so. In this week’s edition of WiR, we cover researchers figuring out a way to “jailbreak” Teslas, the AI.com domain name switching hands and the FCC fining robocallers. Also featured are stories about WeWork’s perennial struggles, Google’s Messages app fully embracing RCS, and spyware maker LetMeSpy shutting down after a massive data breach. If you haven’t already, sign up here to get WiR in your inbox every Saturday. Now, on with the recap. Jailbreak your Tesla: A group of researchers say that they’ve found a way to hack the hardware underpinning Tesla’s infotainment system, allowing them to get what normally would be paid upgrades — such as heated rear seats — for free. Lorenzo has the story. AI.com switches hands: A few months back, OpenAI seemingly purchased the domain AI.com in order to redirect it to the web app for its AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT. But now AI.com redirects to X.ai, Elon Musk’s machine learning research outfit — suggesting that the CEO of X (formerly known as Twitter) has come into possession of the domain. FCC fines robocallers: The FCC has fined a robocaller a record $300 million after blocking billions of their scam calls. But as Devin writes, whether and when the money will be paid is, as always, something of an open question. WeWork in trouble . . . again: WeWork this week announced a net loss of $397 million for the second quarter on revenue of $877 million. The 13-year-old flexible space provider — which faces both increased competition and declining post-pandemic demand — didn’t mince words, admitting that “substantial doubt exists about [its] ability to continue.” Google Messages embraces RCS: Google said this week that it’s making its Messages by Google app more secure with improvements to RCS, or Rich Communication Services — a protocol aimed at replacing SMS. The company says it’ll now make RCS the default for both new and existing Messages app users, and end-to-end encryption for group chats is now fully rolled out to all RCS users. Google launches Project IDX: In more Google news, the tech giant this week launched Project IDX, an AI-enabled, browser-based development environment for building full-stack web and multiplatform apps. ChatGPT custom instructions expand: OpenAI this week announced that it’s expanding custom instructions — a way to give users more control over how ChatGPT responds — to all users, including those on the free tier of the service. The feature, which was first unveiled in July as a beta for ChatGPT Plus subscribers, allows users to add various preferences and requirements that they want the AI chatbot to consider when responding. Spyware maker shuts down: Poland-based spyware LetMeSpy is no longer operational and said it will shut down after a June data breach wiped out its servers, including its huge trove of data stolen from thousands of victims’ phones. This reporter would venture to say that TechCrunch’s roster of podcasts has something for every interest. This week, as every week, there’s intriguing new material for your listening enjoyment. On Equity, the crew talked about a lawsuit targeting a grant program providing small checks to Black women small-business owners and how some countries are taking a different track, including the U.K. Meanwhile, this week’s episode of Found focused on Anurupa Ganguly, the founder and CEO at Prisms, a startup designing VR math curriculum for middle and high school students. Ganguly talked about how her time as a teacher in the Boston and New York City public school systems provided early inspiration for the company, and what it’s been like selling to schools, as well as her take on company culture in relation to remote and hybrid work. And Chain Reaction hosted Robbie Ferguson, the co-founder and president of Immutable. Immutable is a web3 company consisting of two entities: Immutable Platform, a developer platform for building and scaling Ethereum-based web3 games, and Immutable Games, a web3 game developer and publisher. TC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys — which you know if you’re already a subscriber. If you’re not, consider signing up. Here are a few highlights from this week: Room-temp superconductor? Not so fast: The internet — and more than a few scientists — got their hopes up a couple weeks ago when a team of physicists from South Korea announced that they had created a room-temperature superconductor from a slew of common yet unlikely materials. But, as Tim writes, it’s probably, disappointingly bunk. Taking another look at venture debt: Silicon Valley Bank’s nosedive has soured many on venture debt, and for early-stage companies, it bears being cautious. As an option for growth-stage companies with more predictable cash flow, however, things may be a little different. Haje investigates. Taking a page from mobile gaming: Retaining mobile app subscribers is harder than it was last year, but paywall optimization and gamified UX can help.

Anna is out this week, so I’m back in the saddle for today. Here’s about 1,000 words on something that I’ve been chewing on for a few weeks!  — Alex Modern software companies grow in two key ways. They sell their products and services to new customers, and they sell more of the same to existing clients. The latter category is important as it helps with growth, and profitability. It’s simple enough to understand: As SaaS companies sell their code on a subscription basis, they collect revenues over time. This means that sales costs are upfront and the revenue trails. The upside of having a subscription revenue stream over a one-time sale, even if the latter might be more convenient for cash flow purposes, is that it allows for strong revenue predictability. Everyone loves that. However, spending to land new customers and collecting the sales value later means that SaaS companies can burn a lot of cash to build their customer base. Sounds tough, right? The magic of SaaS, however, is in the upsell. As most software products today charge on a recurring (subscription) or usage basis, they often see revenues from their existing customer base rise over time. This is called net retention, net revenue retention (NRR) or net dollar retention (NDR). There’s not one perfect definition of this metric, so when you read an S-1 filing or similar from a software company, make sure to read how it defines net retention; otherwise you can wind up thinking that its business is better than it really is! How does all that add up to profitability? Simple: Once a SaaS customer has paid back its acquisition costs (and related), its recurring revenues are largely a profit source. And, as customers tend to spend more over time, they also contribute to growth. It’s that combination of long-term profitability, growth and predictability that has made software revenues worth so much over time. However, the net retention reality in the market is evolving in a manner that appears pretty tough for software companies, both large and small. NDR rates are slipping all over the software landscape, meaning that a lot of software companies are seeing their growth rates decline, not due to their inability to sell to new customers — or not merely that problem — but because their existing customers are not buying as much as they used to.

2023-08-12,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/12/ivix-ai-financial-crimes/,TechCrunch,Deal Dive: This AI startup is racking up government customers,"Tax evasion, money laundering and other financial crimes are massive, costly issues. In 2021, the Internal Revenue Service estimated that the U.S. loses $1 trillion a year due to tax evasion alone. IVIX thinks AI can help with that. The Israeli startup uses AI, machine learning and public databases of business activity to help government entities spot tax noncompliance, in addition to other financial crimes. IVIX was founded by Matan Fattal and Doron Passov in 2020. Fattal was working at his prior cybersecurity startup, Silverfort, at the time, but when he discovered how large of an issue these financial crimes are — and how governments didn’t have the technology to fight them — he switched gears. “I was shocked by the magnitude of the problem and the technical gap that they had,” Fattal told TechCrunch+. “State or federal, there are pretty much the same [technological] gaps.” Three years later, the startup has landed government contracts with federal agencies, including the IRS criminal investigation bureau; made notable hires like Don Fort, the former chief of criminal investigations at the IRS; and raised a $12.5 million Series A led by Insight Partners, which was announced last week.

2023-08-12,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/12/fbi-ddos-for-hire-cyberattackers/,TechCrunch,How the FBI goes after DDoS cyberattackers,"In 2016, hackers using a network of compromised internet-connected devices — vulnerable security cameras and routers — knocked some of the then biggest websites on the internet offline for several hours. Twitter, Reddit, GitHub and Spotify all went down intermittently that day, victims of what was at the time one of the largest distributed denial-of-service attacks in history. DDoS is a form of cyberattack where bad actors flood websites with malicious traffic with the goal of taking them offline. DDoS attacks had existed for years before 2016, but the fact that this one incident took down so many major services drew the attention of people who didn’t know much about cybersecurity. Since then, no DDoS attack has ever been so newsworthy, but the problem hasn’t gotten away. On December 15, 2022, right before Christmas — historically a popular time to launch DDoS attacks — the FBI announced that it had taken down dozens of websites that sell what are called booter or stressers, essentially DDoS-for-hire services. These are relatively cheap services that allow people with low or no hacking skills to carry out DDoS attacks. On the same day, the feds also announced that they had arrested seven people who allegedly ran those services. Then, the FBI targeted those services and took down more booter sites in May. All these recent operations — as well as the investigation into Mirai, the malware used in the infamous 2016 attacks — were led by the FBI office in Anchorage. On Wednesday, Elliott Peterson, one of the FBI agents who led those investigations, spoke at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas. Peterson, along with Cameron Schroeder, a prosecutor who specializes in cybercrimes, talked about the work behind the investigations that led to the Christmas and May takedowns. Schroeder also revealed that it was Peterson himself who created the splash pages that replaced the seized websites. Peterson, who has focused on DDoS attacks for a decade, sat down with TechCrunch on Thursday to talk about his work going after the people behind those DDoS services, and identifying which services to take down. He explained what goals law enforcement has with these investigations, how DDoS attacks have changed over the years, who are the people behind them, The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity. TechCrunch: How long have you been investigating DDoS attacks? And how have DDoS attacks changed over time? So probably nine or 10 years. And it’s changed quite a bit. When I started looking at the problem, we were really thinking in terms of the top booter or stresser services, which is where a lot of the market and a lot of the customer base was. And then, in the middle of working investigations into booter and stressers, we got drawn into the botnet world. And so it’s really been kind of this yo-yo back and forth between what we think are the most threatening portions of the DDoS landscape, and then we’ll try to deal with that. And then the criminals react to what we do and change, and we have to relearn, and it’s just been this kind of constant process over about nine or 10 years. What is the biggest change that you’ve seen in the last 10 years? I think in a lot of ways just the expanding of the partners that we have. When we first started, we were trying to work with people that understood and focused on DDoS, and that was a really small subset of the security community. I feel like over the years, we’ve had a lot more partners within the private sector, within academia, and within law enforcement, we’ve had a lot of people really interested in the problem. And maybe this is a little bit of a media bias, but I feel like sometimes there’s a feeling that DDoS is kind of a boring problem, or a problem that’s been solved? Oh, no, no, you’re not wrong at all. We bump up against it all the time. And there’s ways in which it’s kind of true. And there’s ways in which it’s emphatically not true. But if you look at the transitory, temporary nature of some DDoS attacks, it’s a problem while it’s going on, and maybe it’s a problem when the attack stops.

			“Generally, if you’re big enough to be in the news, you start to be on our radar.”							Elliott Peterson, FBI


 If somebody is intending only to temporarily disrupt a website or person, it’s a little bit of a problem or a lot of a problem during it, and then afterwards, they might forget or move on. Now, DDoS at a certain scale or volume is an entirely different problem. And so, a lot of the people that say DDoS isn’t a problem are crying for the hills when their websites are down continually, or there’s a threat that’s so large, that there’s not a mitigation pathway. I think what’s kind of unique of what FBI Anchorage has been doing is we’ve been really focused on that crime-type throughout that period. And it’s allowed us to respond a lot more quickly when it does become a really sustained problem. But by volume, it is one of the largest cybercrime problems in terms of the frequency of attacks, for example. How large is it in terms of financial losses? That’s harder to determine. You have cases where there’s extortion or a victim might pay a certain amount of money. But DDoS has a lot of indirect costs. If I’m getting DDoS’ed continually, a lot of victims can pay their way outside of the power of the attacker, but that is incrementally increasing their bandwidth costs. That’s really hard for us to capture, I think. But if you look at just the size of some of the companies that specialize in DDoS mitigation, for example, you have very large companies that that’s their business model. So, I don’t want to put a price tag on it. Yeah, Cloudflare is a giant company… As is Akamai, as is Fastly. There’s a lot of that. And every ISP will have plans that certain customers get pushed to because it’s maybe the way to stay outside of certain DDoS services. We think that it’s one of the things where it increases the expense for everybody on the internet, but it’s hard to know exactly how much. And so how do you choose who to go after? It’s a huge problem, how do you pick your battles?  One of the things that I think it’s the most exciting is that we have that ability to choose, we can look at it, and think about it. Generally, we’re prioritizing top services. So, who is conducting the most attacks? Who’s been around the longest? Who has the most customers? Who’s capable of conducting the largest attacks for booter stresser services? When we make questions about how are we focusing on — for example — botnets? It’s a similar methodology. But generally, if you’re big enough to be in the news, you start to be on our radar. And then we might pause and focus on something like that. Like Mirai from a few years ago.  Yeah, and that was an FBI Anchorage case. It’s a great example of everyone says, ‘DDoS doesn’t matter.’ And then you finally have a botnet like Mirai and for a while DDoS really matters. That was actually a case we worked from start to finish in Anchorage, and basically used everything we’d learned about booter stresser services and pivoted and dealt with Mirai, and then came back to work on booter stresser services. Mirai was huge, I remember there was that day the internet kind of went down for a few or a couple of hours, which is crazy to think about now. What’s the goal? Obviously, catching criminals, but is it deterrence? Is it getting access to low level criminals so that you can then go after bigger services? What’s the thinking? I think, big picture, our thinking is what can we learn in trying to reduce the threat of these services that we can apply to other crime types? What can we learn in combating these DDoS services, both to make the internet safer, but also maybe to apply to ransomware, remote access trojans or other types of internet tools? That’s by and large what Cameron [Schroeder] and I were trying to discuss. But we think it’s a problem that people only pay attention to a little bit of the time, and we think we’re having a lot of success by focusing on it all the time. How effective has been the deterrence? At some point Schroeder said that after one big operation that there was a 20% decrease in DDoS activity. Can you talk more about that?  We’re ascribing value to numbers. But because we can measure DDoS and because we can accurately look at where DDoS is and follow trajectories, we have an estimate that probably our last operation saw a pretty sustained net 20% reduction on daily attack volume. Other operations we’ve seen less or more than that. What’s neat this time is at least it looks like it’s sustained. Maybe some portion of the customer base maybe moved on. And that’s really our goal: a combination of educating people that this is criminal, holding people accountable and trying to not be in a position where young men and some young women grow up accustomed to having access to these tools. Because when you’ve had access to the kind of firepower that you can get for $20 a month — that, by the way, if you wanted that kind of bandwidth, at home you’d be paying $250-$350 a month or more — what we see is people become habituated having that, so they just continue to use these services. We’d really like to explain to people that it’s criminal, they shouldn’t do it, so we can focus on other crime problems. You said that for the last there was a 20% decrease. That’s the March or the Christmas operation? That was Christmas and March. There’s a whole sequence of operations that came out after Christmas. We saw about a 20% overall reduction in the attack volumes. But we’re hoping to have much better data soon, as some of these universities study that. Is going after the booters also in part trying to dismantle the botnets behind them? To me, they’re functionally very different things with the exception that we have had booter services that have tied themselves to botnets or added botnet capability. But if we consider botnets victim devices, and generally, those are conducting what are often called layer 7, or TCP-based attacks, and they can be very powerful because you can make the infected victim that comprises the botnet, essentially interact with the intended victim. Whereas most of the time with booters, they’re conducting these clever attacks where they’re magnifying their data. But at the end of the day, it’s all unrequested UDP. It’s just sheer bandwidth, it can be filtered, it can be dropped. The botnets, generally, that’s a lot more challenging. We look at them as different threats. But we understand that they sort of exist within the same criminal economy. The difference is that botnets tend to be a lot more expensive. You have people that have larger criminal economic goals, they’re often using botnets, or you have other cases where the booting services tend to be a lot cheaper and have a different clientele. I guess it’s fair to say that maybe the botnets are not for kids that want to disrupt gaming? They can be, but generally a botnet is something that you are using to disrupt an entire gaming service, let’s say, because the number of bots and then the peak available capacity of those bots isn’t always greater than what you would see with a booter but often it is. The use case becomes a little different. Where we often see botnets being successful is they might take down the entire gaming service and not just kick somebody out of a game. Now that we are talking about it, I remember a few years ago when the whole PlayStation Network went down, it was Christmas day or the day after Christmas.

			“Our hope is not to arrest everybody, our hope is to arrest the most problematic people and convince the rest of the people that this isn’t a good path.”							Elliott Peterson, FBI


 That would have been Star Patrol, and there were a few other names like Lizard Squad. That was right before Mirai took off. A really funny — and long story that we don’t have time for — is that part of Mirai’s development was driven by competition, because the group that did those Christmas attacks had an [Internet of Things] botnet that was very effective. They both were aware of the same vulnerability. And whoever controlled that vulnerability, controlled hundreds of thousands devices. They were actually fighting with each other to see who would be able to control all of those devices. That is actually what drove a lot of the advancement that made Mirai so effective. Sometimes you time your operations around times when DDoS attacks are more prevalent, like Christmas, for example in 2022. What’s the motivation behind doing this?  Exactly what you described. You’ve had this historical tendency where Christmas is the busiest DDoS period for a lot of reasons. We’ve started trying to time operations to coincide; where in the vacuum created by our takedowns through December, DDoS is a lot harder to do, because the operators that weren’t arrested are going back to have to reset up their stuff. Everyone’s generally a little alarmed at what the next shoe is going to drop. That’s why we’ve timed it. In some ways, we’re setting ourselves up where we’re competing with the most intense DDoS period. We could pick a different time and maybe see more of a reduction, but that’s why. Banks and other industries can get really nervous around Christmas time. This changed that landscape a little bit. Does it also send a message to the criminals themselves? Ideally, what we’re trying to do is send this broad message of deterrence. Our hope is not to arrest everybody, our hope is to arrest the most problematic people and convince the rest of the people that this isn’t a good path. And speaking of the cyber criminals, you said yesterday that there are some wrong assumptions about them, both in terms of who uses these services and who runs them? Yeah, DDoS to me has a very distinct cybercriminal profile. Generally, you’re going to have somebody based in North America or Western Europe. They generally will communicate in gaming, they’re usually young adult males, they can be engaged in other cybercrime types, but often DDoS may be one of the most popular types. They’re usually adjacent in some way to gaming, and they’re often making $30,000-$50,000 to $100,000 a year, depending on how big their services are. They often start maybe between 16 and 19 [years of age], and by the time they are top service — and we catch up to them — they are somewhere between 19 and 25 [years old], usually, in terms of a profile. That’s not bad money for that kind of age. And that’s the problem, right? That’s what we’ve been trying to figure out is where you have this economic driver for the crime type, it makes it harder to move people away from the service. And how sophisticated are they? Because you showed that they make some pretty bad OPSEC mistakes. I would say that because of the crime type, and because of who their customers are, I would say that they’re generally not as sophisticated as you might consider some of the more traditional cyber actors. But that’s not even entirely fair, because criminals who are offering services tend to be more sophisticated than the criminals that are consuming the services. If I look at somebody operating a DDoS service, they are usually much more technically sophisticated than their customers. But they may not be far behind somebody doing a remote access trojan or somebody doing something else, because by and large, the tools they’re using have been placed online. So, a little bit of web development, [and] a lot of customer service experience is often required for them to be successful. There’s a lot of back and forth with customers that these guys have to be willing to do if they want to make money. FBI discussing DDoS-for-hire sites at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas. Image Credit: FBI (supplied) You mentioned yesterday that some people don’t even use VPNs. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Tons of people don’t use VPNs. It’s really a misconception, I think, in the cybercrime space that all of these actors are using VPNs. And even when they’re using VPNs, a lot of actors still don’t fortunately understand the ways that we often have to push past VPNs. In the booter space, it’s probably more uncommon than common for me to see VPN usage. But that’s not untrue for other crime types where people don’t think they can be caught. Because the actor is using this criminal service and he’s been told there’s no logs kept by the criminal actor, he doesn’t necessarily feel the same need to have a VPN engaged as he might try to cash out credentials from a bank or something. I think that some of it is, they exist in a place where they think that they already have some protection. And so once you identify who to go after, what’s the evidence that you’re looking for, and how do you collect it? It depends on if we’re looking for customers or if we’re looking for operators. For operators, as we laid out in the presentation, what we’re trying to establish is does their service work because we want to focus our time on people who are actually really facilitating DDoS generally? And if their service works, then we’re going to ask questions about who set that service off, and once we start to establish that, we will often ask questions about their communication accounts. What are they using, and how are they communicating? And most of the time, that’ll take us over a period of months to know where we think somebody’s located, and then we go and ask a judge for permission to basically go and take evidence from them, and interview them. That starts this process where I would take all of that accumulated evidence, and we give that to a prosecutor, and then they make decisions about how we go forward. So that’s on the people’s side. At what point do you decide to seize and shut down the services? And why do you decide to do it then?  What’s fun about this case is because we’re trying to do so much simultaneously, we will batch things. So like my investigation, I might be batching questions about a bunch of actors, but I obviously can’t usually visit everybody on the same day. We might spread all of our searches out over a period of a month or two months. But we’ll usually pick a date, not just with us but with our partners. Sometimes you won’t hit that date. That’s what’s really complicated in this space. To have so many things happen simultaneously, like we’ve been able to do, we have to commit to a date often months out, and everyone will have different roles, and it adds a lot of pressure. The one thing we usually have done well in advance of that date is we’re ready, we know who we want to charge. But the mechanisms of taking the service stuff away is really complicated. And somebody might change hosting a week before we do it, or something else could change that we’re scrambling. What’s the role of the private sector in fighting DDoS attacks? In a lot of ways, they’re the front lines. They are the hosting companies, or the DDoS defense companies that are really focused on this. They do an incredible job of making sure we understand the science and technology we need to keep up with this. If there’s a new attack technique, or a new service, they’re often where we hear about that first. They’re providing us the information we need to make better decisions, and that’s been most of the role that we’ve filled with them. They’re helping us shape our strategy by giving us feedback in terms of what they think will or won’t work. And that isn’t necessarily a question about which service to go after, or what we should say to these actors during interviews, but more like: Should we do this at Christmas? Which protocols should we prioritize for our testing of these services? How can we test these services without causing too much harm? So it’s really like a team sport? Very much, yes. And what message would you send to victims of DDoS? Let us know. We do a lot of consulting in Anchorage for victims of DDoS, especially large platforms that get hit. There’s ways to report it. We’re not necessarily doing technical remediation, but we try to help victims understand is this a short term attack? Is this a long term attack? Do you understand the motivations of the attacker? Because if you know what the motivations are of the attacker, and you know how they’re attacking you, we can also help them understand how much the attacker is probably paying to do this. That can be important because an attacker who’s mad enough at a business that they have thousands of dollars to spend, that puts them in an entirely different risk category than an attacker that’s using a cheap plan on a booting service. We’re encouraging victims to reach out to us. If they’re victims of DDoS attacks, if they’ve lost money. If it’s a lot of attacks, we’d love to know and talk to them. You said yesterday that you’re still not making the hackers’ lives hard enough. What are doing or going to do differently going forward? Our hope is to continue to learn how to conduct more effective operations, which might mean larger, more moving pieces, [and] more partners. Our next phase is taking a really hard look at some of these customers that probably don’t think that we have the data we do, and also shifting to including more of the customers and basically holding them accountable for their attacks. Finally, can you tell me about your experience making the logos for the seizure notices? We get feedback from some of our partners, especially international law enforcement, who have a lot of experience with these takedowns and these seizures. And so they’re the ones that say, ‘hey we are doing these really smooth blue seizure pages.’ And like, ‘no, it has to be red, you’ve got to communicate viscerally to them this idea of stop.’ It seems simple, but how do you get a background everybody agrees on, whose logo goes where, how large, and there’s all these funny things that you don’t expect to have to deal with, that we get asked to do? Because we don’t really have a graphic support department to help us with a lot of that. Did you put the Christmas hats on the logos? No, researchers did that. And honestly I had lost a battle. I tried to use that as our official logo next time, and I was told we couldn’t, because I thought that would just be really a funny gesture."

2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/its-official-better-com-is-going-public/,TechCrunch,It’s official: Better.com is going public,"We didn’t think we’d see the day. Digital mortgage lender Better.com’s proposal to combine with Aurora Acquisition Corp. via a SPAC (special purpose acquisition) has been approved by shareholders, the company confirmed today. According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Better.com will combine with Aurora, or go public, “on or about August 22, 2023.”   “At least 65% of the outstanding ordinary shares of the company entitled to vote at this meeting have voted in favor of (the) proposal,” Arnaud Massenet, CEO of Aurora Acquisition Corp, said in a shareholder’s meeting on Friday, as reported by HousingWire. Upon the closing of the transaction, the combined entity will see an infusion of at least $550 million in new capital from SoftBank, according to Aurora’s filing with the SEC in July. It could also receive another $200 million. If Novator, an investment firm that sponsors Aurora, exercises its $100 million option, then SoftBank is required to match. In late November 2021, we reported that Aurora Acquisition Corp. and SoftBank decided to amend the terms of their financing agreement to immediately provide Better with half of the $1.5 billion they had committed instead of waiting until the deal closed.  Better.com had originally began making plans to go public via a $7.7 billion SPAC in May 2021. Things took a dramatic turn for the worse later that year, and the SPAC was delayed. With so many challenges facing Better.com over the past two years – including layoffs, high-profile executive resignations, a housing market slowdown and negative publicity – industry observers were skeptical that the company’s going-public plans would actually materialize. TechCrunch reported last week that the long-awaited vote for Better.com to go public was scheduled for today ahead of the extended deadline to complete the merger deal on September 30. In late July, Aurora had said in an SEC filing that shareholders would be asked to vote on a proposal that if the SPAC merger did take place, with Aurora surviving the merger, Aurora would change its name to “Better Home & Finance Holding Company.” Last year, Better.com declared that it intended to move forward with its planned public debut, despite the lackluster performance of blank-check combinations in previous quarters. Better.com itself had seen its fair share of turbulence since it announced its plans to merge with a SPAC, including multiple botched layoffs (more on those here and here) and changing market conditions that impacted parts of its business, including a surge in mortgage interest rates. In one layoffs meeting, CEO Vishal Garg famously was recorded saying the company had “probably pissed away $200 million.“ Last week, TechCrunch reported that the SEC had said it did not intend to recommend an enforcement action against Better.com. The pronouncement came after an investigation on the part of the SEC to determine if violations of federal securities laws had occurred. Last July, the SEC began looking into whether Better.com had violated federal securities laws, requesting documents from both the company and SPAC partner Aurora Acquisition Corp. about their business activities.  The embattled fintech startup laid off its real estate team on June 7, shifting from an in-house agent model to a partnership agent model. It also continues to bleed cash. According to HousingWire, other Aurora filings from July show that Better.com had posted a net loss of $89.9 million in Q1 2023 and had slashed about 91% of its workforce over an approximately 18-month period. While Better.com seems to have narrowed its loss compared to a net loss of $327.7 million in the first quarter of 2022, it’s clearly still struggling.

2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/okay-fine-i-want-elon-musk-and-mark-zuckerberg-to-fight/,TechCrunch,"Okay, fine, I want Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to fight","Elon Musk has disappointed me many times. He bought my favorite social network and made it bad. He has mistreated workers across his companies, and he has permanently ruined the enduring comedy of 420 and 69 jokes. And today, he got my hopes up that he was actually going to cage fight Mark Zuckerberg. I know better than to take anything Elon says at face value. I have been part of numerous editorial conversations about how to write about a man who runs several exceptionally powerful companies, yet constantly talks out of his ass and cannot deliver on his promises. But something seemed different this morning, when he tweeted (yes, I’m still calling them tweets) that the fight was on. “I spoke to the PM of Italy and Minister of Culture. They have agreed on an epic location,” Musk wrote. “Everything done will pay respect to the past and present of Italy.” Seemed like a pretty definitive statement! He even vowed to donate proceeds to veterans? But then, the Meta CEO had to go and bring us back down to Earth. “I love this sport and I’ve been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me,” Zuckerberg wrote on Threads, Meta’s Twitter competitor. “If he ever agrees on an actual date, you’ll hear it from me. Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on.” Let’s get one thing out of the way: it is very funny that the two CEOs are playing telephone and sassing one another on the respective microblogging platforms that they own, rather than actually speaking to each other. But that aside, Zuck’s post disappointed me. For one thing, Darrell once agreed to send me to Rome to cover the fight at the Colosseum, and I am 99.99% sure that Darrell was joking, but hey, a squeaky wheel gets the grease. What’s key here is that no one at TechCrunch has definitively said, “No, Amanda, we will not pay for you to go to Rome to watch two billionaires fight.” But I’m not delusional. I know that my desire to eat fresh pasta is not an editorial priority, though a girl can dream. So why was I so disappointed to hear from Zuck that Elon has once again let me down? It wasn’t because I genuinely believed that I would be going to Rome for the event. Instead, I had to confront an inconvenient truth about the person I’ve become. I want Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to cage fight. Musk and Zuckerberg both cause me significant distress — not just because I write about them, but because I care about humanity (and no, not in the Muskian way where he seems to believe we should all become baby-making machines in our little space pods on Mars). Zuckerberg’s decisions as the head of a platform used by billions have in part led to genocide and the obstruction of democracy. Musk’s negligence when it comes to all things content moderation and platform safety could engender similar consequences. It’s exhausting to watch these powerful men continually make the same mistakes, refusing to learn from themselves or each other. And then, Congress steps in to try to regulate these companies, but inadvertently proposes legislation that just makes things worse. So, I made a deal with myself. If I’m going to write about social media and stay sane, I need to root for the dumbest things possible to happen, so long as the consequences don’t actually cause harm. The Musk v. Zuckerberg cage fight is the perfect representation of this: it’s so stupid, but the only people who will actually get hurt are the perpetrators of this stupidity themselves. And that’s all before we even get into the cage fight itself. I love watching men fall victim to their own hubris — call me Homer — and that’s exactly what Musk has coming for him. When he’s not trying to convince us to wear VR headsets all day, Zuckerberg is getting swole. Really. He’s found the time to win Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tournaments, all while coming up with one-liners to get investors off his back about how much money Reality Labs is losing. Musk, meanwhile, has spent his free time commissioning massive, illegal light installations and suing non-profit hate speech watchdogs. Zuckerberg is so undeniably the favorite to win this fight, but Musk can’t back down because he’s already made a public commitment. It’s like when he pledged $44 billion to buy Twitter and then changed his mind, except this time, there’s not even any money at stake. I don’t even care to watch the actual fight — that’s not what interests me. It’s the fragility of the male ego, for me. You can have more money than anyone in the world, yet still have such a delicate sense of self that you’ll agree to get your ass kicked inside of an ancient world wonder.

2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-bail-revoked-ahead-of-october-trial/,TechCrunch,Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail revoked ahead of October trial," Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, had his bail revoked ahead of his October trial, US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan said on Friday. The decision came after allegations that Bankman-Fried leaked the diary of Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX’s investment-arm Alameda Research, to the New York Times. Kaplan announced the decision in a federal court in Manhattan on Friday afternoon. Bankman-Fried is facing a number of charges, including defrauding FTX investors, from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Southern District of New York’s attorney’s office. He plead not guilty to U.S. criminal charges earlier this year. Initially, Bankman-Fried requested access to Google Drive, which he said was “for discovery,” Inner City Press reported that Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon said on Friday at the hearing. “Then he used it to give Ms. Ellison’s documents to the New York Times.” In a July 26 hearing, Kaplan inhibited Bankman-Fried from speaking publicly about his case, six days after the New York Times article on Ellison’s diary was published. He was formerly under house arrest at his parents’ home in Palo Alto, Calif., on a $250 million bond, since his December 2022 arrest, but is now facing repercussions for allegedly intimidating witnesses like Ellison. The federal judge said a gag order wasn’t sufficient given Bankman-Fried’s repeated misbehavior for crossing “a line.” Kaplan said during the hearing there is a “possibility that he will be detained at the [The Metropolitan Detention Center], not on anyone’s list of five star facilities.” But noted Bankman-Fried may be able to have a “dedicated laptop” at the jail in Brooklyn, New York, for nine to 11 hours a day. In late December, Ellison and former FTX co-founder Gary Wang plead guilty to multiple charges and accepted plea agreements that offer reduced sentencing in exchange for cooperating with U.S. authorities. This is a developing story and may be updated as more information arises. "

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday. Fri-yay indeed. We sigh, as humans spool up to take a break, while the semi-sentient machines continue writing their poetry in their air-conditioned underground data-center homes. In my column this week, I spent a bit of time thinking about the times that robots have had an impact on my life. That time I ran a chatbot company talking with people about death. That time I felt a connection with a game character. And that time I tried to imagine what it would be like to be a sentient AI knowing it was about to get shut off. It’s a series of thought experiments I’ve been playing with for a long time, and the idea was reawakened by reading Becky Chambers’ excellent Wayfarers series. The second installment goes into great depth about what happens when an AI is rebooted — will she come back with all her memories intact? Or does something change when you go back to your default software? Well worth a read, if you want to be a philoso-fish, swimming in the philoso-sea. Anyway, on with the news! Image Credits: Getty Images / ktsimage Over the past couple of weeks, the internet went positively bonkers over the possibility of superconductors operating without being chilled to near absolute zero, after a team of researchers in South Korea claimed they had something cooked up in the lab that worked. The problem, in part, was that they claimed to have used a material (lead apatite) that not only isn’t a known superconductor, but also isn’t, in fact, conductive at all. YHBT, YHL, HAND, as they used to say in the early days of the internet. Still, for the briefest of glimpses, on TC+, Tim explored the potential of such a development and the vast-ranging impacts it would have on, well, everything we know about electricity, electronics, and much more. Of course, it seems it may not have been true, and reminded us of the iffy claims made by another company back in March, also involving the elusive room-temp superconductivity. Alas, ’twas not to be this time either, but the hunt continues. Less confusion, more fusion: Tim is basically single-handedly carrying this entire section this week — well done, squire — reporting how scientists repeat a breakthrough fusion experiment, netting more power than before, bringing us one baby step closer to usable fusion power. If you love yourself some sustainability, get your behind (and the rest of you, please. If you turn up at the doors, just a pair of levitating buttocks, we have achieved some sort of superconduction, but you’ll have made an ass of yourself, and security will probably turn you away) to TechCrunch Disrupt, where we have a whole Sustainability Stage planned! Image Credits: Getty Images / Souda As Bitcoin is back nudging $30,000, web3 is maturing and people are finally able to have some conversations about blockchains without talking about the abjectly stupid pyramid schemes that collectable digital primates represented (I sniggered all the way through “The Beanie Bubble” and then laughed out loud when the final punchline hit). It made me come up for air for a moment and look at what’s happening out in crypto land. Investment into the sector certainly isn’t much to shout about right now, with venture funding declining for seventh straight quarter (TC+). A charitable read would be that the bubble is gone and that investors are now only making clearheaded investments into the companies that make sense. Or maybe the “invest while it’s hot” crew have just pivoted their attention to AI, and the hard core believers are left standing. My unveiled cynicism and abject lack of faith in the sector aside, there’s some interesting movement in the space: AI, meet web3. Web3, AI: Always worth paying attention when Goliath shifts on his throne, and Jacquelyn’s report that Microsoft partners with the Aptos blockchain (TC+) to marry AI and web3 got a huge amount of attention — and traffic — on TechCrunch this week. Contractually smarter: About nine months after raising its Series A, SettleMint’s launches its AI assistant, which aims to help web3 developers write better smart contracts. Followin’ the money: Tracking who invests in what and when is an ever-green effort. Our estranged sibling site Crunchbase does it for VC and startups, and EdgeIn jumps in to be a faster, community-driven version of the same, especially focused on web3. Image Credits: Sirinarth Mekvorawuth / EyeEm / Getty Images Watching legal systems trying to wrap their heads around even pretty basic technology continues to be cringe-musing, and there was a lot of that sort of thing going on this week. The Chinese government is in uproar after Biden bans U.S. funding flowing into semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. In India, the government decided that it would restrict laptops, tablets, and other personal computers to boost local manufacturers but was met with the appropriate mix of uproar and ridicule, and quickly announced it would delay that particular harebrained idea from taking hold. Also in India, the IT minister resurrected a previously abandoned data privacy bill and is pushing ahead with it, despite criticism. The EU wasn’t going to be outdone, though, and stuck its oar in as well. TikTok is launching a “For You” feed aimed at the European market but without its algorithm. Worldcoin’s official launch triggers privacy scrutiny, and it turns out the European Commission (EC) isn’t too psyched about Adobe’s $20 billion Figma acquisition, either, confirming an in-depth probe into the deal. Finally, Meta says it will offer European users a choice to deny tracking. More? Fine. There’s a lesson there: Dominic-Madori takes a dive into the U.K. venture landscape and argues that the U.S. could learn a lot from how the U.K. is crafting DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) policy for the industry. Just can’t face it: The pervasive use of facial recognition technology across all facets of life in China has elicited both praise for its convenience and backlash around privacy concerns. Rita reports that China is considering measures that demand “individual consent” for facial recognition use. Eye see you: A Kenyan government agency suspended Worldcoin’s activities, citing concerns with “authenticity and legality.” It plans to resume iris scans in Kenya, but the debate continues about whether the crypto-powered identification scheme is using the data it is collecting in accordance with local law. Across the site, here are some of the startup stories y’all flocked to since the previous Startups Weekly. Karma, karma, karma, karma, komeuppance: Apparently not entirely immune to irony, spyware maker LetMeSpy shuts down after hacker deletes server data. That won’t have been cheap: The value domain AI.com, which until recently was pointing to ChatGPT, suddenly started sending traffic to Elon Musk’s X.ai this week. Ultimately, no one actually cares who owns AI.com, but speculation in the land of domain selling and buying ran rife as to how much money might have changed hands in the process. You want how much for a ride to the airport?: Lyft wants to kill surge pricing, because “riders hate it with a fiery passion.” Yes, yes, we do.

We even kind of like reverse mergers. But this latest development in the robotics industry sure has us excited! Delivery robots maker Serve Robotics is going public via a reverse merger with a blank-check company, and it raised $30 million just before the deal. That could be great for the company, but we’re more interested in the visibility this deal grants us into the economics of building, deploying and running a fleet of delivery robots. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. On one hand, using people to move goods around cities is expensive and can contribute to congestion and pollution. On the other, when has anything about robotics been cheap? Using tech instead of flesh and blood usually results in savings — you only need to look around yourself to realize the benefits of the industrial revolution and the Internet. But robotics can prove tricky even for smaller sidewalk-level devices, despite recent advances. So, how good is Serve’s business? We do not know. What we can tell from the numbers, however, is that it’s still early days for companies deploying hundreds or even thousands of robots to bring you food and groceries. When a company files to go public, we usually sigh with excitement because we get to pore over its last few years’ financial results to understand the business’ health and valuation prospects. Serve doesn’t fit that model well. The company recorded no revenue in 2021 and managed a mere six figures of topline in 2022, so we are not dealing with your traditional tech shop on its way to the public markets. Serve has a good reason for working to go public, though: As my colleague Kirsten wrote, following the SVB crisis, the company found itself on uncertain financial ground, which led its co-founder and CEO Ali Kashani to take a closer look at the company’s approach to raising capital, and he decided Serve needed a broader scope of investors.

2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/fearless-fund-lawsuit-civil-rights/,TechCrunch,The civil rights movement comes to venture capital,"For the last year and a half, there is only one point I’ve sought to make with my venture coverage: that the industry is not separate from sociopolitical context. That the tech industry and its backers are not separate from the economic fabric of this nation and the mores of our society. This became evident when the American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER) announced last week that it was suing Fearless Fund. The AAER was launched by Edward Blum, the man who helped overturn affirmative action, alleging that its race-conscious policies discriminated against Asian Americans. AAER is accusing Fearless Fund of racially discriminating against white and Asian Americans because it awards a $20,000 grant only to Black women-owned small businesses. But as anyone with knowledge of who the venture community backs today knows: Black women raise around 0.4% of all venture capital funds in any given year, and grant programs like what Fearless built were created to fill that funding gap. How venture capital is allocated to Black founders has always been a civil rights issue, just one river feeding the ocean of persistent economic segregation. Earlier this year, three white men filed to sue the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) and the funding given to it by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The suit alleges that how the funds were allocated was racially discriminatory and violated the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause because the MBDA offers programs only for those from “socially or economically disadvantaged” backgrounds, which presumably does not include white Americans. The lawsuit resulted in a preliminary injunction against the MBDA’s business centers for unconstitutional racial discrimination. More recently, a federal court in Tennessee filed an injunction against the Small Business Administration’s business development program after ruling that the SBA should stop taking race and ethnicity into account when it makes contracting decisions. “There’s clearly a pattern here in recent months of courts and politically motivated plaintiffs going after public agencies like the MBDA and the SBA and private organizations like Fearless Fund,” John Dearie, the founder and president of the Center for American Entrepreneurship, told me. “That’s very worrying.” Ed Zimmerman, a startup investing lawyer, pointed out the significance of AAER not going after diversity initiatives from more-prominent institutions, like Goldman Sach’s Launch with GS or the Andreessen Horowitz cultural funds. “What [AAER] didn’t do was take on very well-funded, heavily lawyered organizations that have the resources and personpower to fight back,” Zimmerman told me. Fearless Fund’s legal team isn’t too shabby, though. It hired a team of heavy-hitting civil rights lawyers, including Ben Crump, best known for representing the families of George Floyd and Henrietta Lacks, whose stolen cancer cells changed the medical landscape.

2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/bytedance-again-looks-to-tiktok-to-promote-its-other-social-app-lemon8/,TechCrunch,"ByteDance again looks to TikTok to promote its other social app, Lemon8","TikTok appears to be working on an integration with Lemon8, another social app owned by TikTok’s Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, according to new findings from product intelligence firm Watchful.ai. The apparent new partnership sees TikTok developing a feature that would allow users to sync their Lemon8 posts to TikTok, then add sounds and music to the posts using TikTok’s editor. Watchful could not provide screenshots of the feature in question, but notes that its methodology uses a combination of computer vision, machine learning algorithms, and flow analysis of publicly available data to identify and emulate app changes. That allows Watchful to discover features before they launch publicly, as it has done many times before. Most recently,  it uncovered TikTok features in development like the AI chatbot Tako, a dedicated Shop feed, video stickers and more. TikTok did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the matter. Lemon8, as you may recall, rapidly rose up the App Store charts earlier this year around the same time that U.S. lawmakers were discussing moving forward with a TikTok ban or forced sale. The app, a lifestyle social network, had originally launched in arch 2020 but was artificially inflated on TikTok this spring. With suspicious timing, the app “went viral” on TikTok’s video platform after numerous influencers posted positive videos promoting Lemon8 using similar language describing it as a mix of Pinterest and Instagram. None of the videos we came across at the time indicated they were sponsored content or ads. This forced popularity, in turn, pushed Lemon8 into the Top 10 Overall apps in the U.S. App Store for several days in March 2023. Ahead of this, Insider reported that ByteDance had been paying creators to post about Lemon8 on TikTok to seed its initial U.S. user base and content. From the looks of things, it seemed that ByteDance’s hope was that Lemon8 could serve as something of a backup plan to gain U.S. users’ engagement and attention in the event of a full TikTok ban. If the newly spotted cross-posting feature does, in fact, roll out more publicly, ByteDance would be able to leverage TikTok once again to further gain attention for Lemon8, driving new installs and adoption. However, it’s unclear at this time if or when the cross-pollination feature will launch, or whether it’s only something under consideration for now. Currently, Lemon8 has 25 million estimated worldwide downloads, per market intelligence firm data.ai. Its top 5 markets are Thailand (36% of installs), Japan (24%), Indonesia (21%), Malaysia (7.2%), and the U.S. (7%)."
2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/baldurs-gate-3-early-review-modern-fantasy/,TechCrunch,Baldur’s Gate 3 early review: Modern fantasy,"First, the basics. Baldur’s Gate 3 is a Dungeons & Dragons game through and through, but you don’t need to be familiar with that world or those systems to enjoy it. It’s a dense roleplaying adventure that alternates between an old-school isometric view and close-up, voice-acted cut scenes, offering players a world of choice through complex cascades of cause and effect. If some roleplaying video games throw you into the deep end of the swimming pool with their ethical dilemmas, Baldur’s Gate 3 pushes you into the Mariana Trench, hands bound, and tosses a pocket knife in after you. And I mean that in the best way possible.  The game offers a fascinating slice of one of D&D’s major settings, the Forgotten Realms, introducing you to gods, monsters and space-faring alien civilizations in a way that’s much more compelling than your average black and white good vs. evil fantasy retelling. No matter what you set out to do, you’ll make Faustian bargains wrapped in Sophie’s choices — and given the complexity and layered world, no two playthroughs are the same. If any of that sounds even remotely compelling, this is a game for you. Baldur’s Gate 3 follows Baldur’s Gate 2, one of the best-loved RPGs of all-time — and one that was released over two decades ago. Ghent, Belgium-based developer Larian Studios was tapped to craft the sequel, which at the time was incredible news for anyone familiar with Larian’s stellar track record. Personally, I’d only played Larian’s last game, the awkwardly-named Divinity: Original Sin II, but that game’s wildly rich, interactive world was enough for me to immediately download Baldur’s Gate 3 at launch. This game plays very similarly, but benefits from the combined boons of a massive budget, D&D’s rich systems and its lore. I’d never played prior D&D video games, but like a lot of people, I started playing the tabletop game with friends during the pandemic. I’m probably more into the crunch — the technical side: subclasses, modifiers, et cetera — than the average person and watching everything you’d write on a character sheet come to life in three voice-acted dimensions is very cool. Gamers well-versed in D&D’s spells and classes will certainly find an easier learning curve, but from my 25-ish hours in the game so far, anyone who likes to sink into a tactically-minded game or just loves roleplaying will find a ton to enjoy here.  Larian loves the gray areas and Baldur’s Gate 3 is all about player choice. Unlike a normal on-rails RPG, the game sets you loose from its earliest moments. Everything is interactive and problem solving in the game feels like the best moments in tabletop D&D. Want to get behind a guarded locked door and into an ornate chest? Cast an illusion spell to create a diversion, have your rogue pick the lock and sneak back out. Or, have your warlock — a famous monster slayer named Wyll with some dark secrets — teleport into the room and back out again while you chat up the guard. Alternatively you could kill the guards, break the door down, or use a Knock spell to open it with magic — and those are just easy options off the top of my head. Most of the game’s encounters are wide open to whatever players can dream up, something Baldur’s Gate 3 shares in common with the other obvious game of the year frontrunner, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Both games set a new high bar for how interactive a game world can be, encouraging imaginative solutions in a way that the modern crop of Ubisoft-style open world games chock full of menial errands and shallow quests never could. Part of the way through Act 1 of Baldur’s Gate 3 — a bit over 20 hours in — the game is anything but shallow. Like with the game’s interactive systems and inherent logic puzzles, the developers also treat the player like they’re clever enough to handle a bit of complexity. Moral gray areas are on full display within your troubled pack of heroes (or villains, or more likely something in between) and their relationships to communities you’ll encounter in your travels. The dialogue is snappy and often very funny, making roleplaying through the game’s incredible animated social scenes a joy, an experience only deepened by the game’s thoughtfully diverse world of characters. As with the well-guarded chest scenario above, Baldur’s Gate gives you a breadth of social options. When you catch your conspicuously pale new adventuring companion Astarion trying to bite your neck in the night, you can respond by attacking him, warning him off or sympathetically lending him a little of your own blood, just this once. The other characters are equally flawed and charming, particularly Karlach, my future wife, a demon-like tiefling jock who escaped the hells and is ready to have a good time. The only character I don’t love so far is our literally power hungry wizard, a choice that feels right because a) he’s the token human white guy and b) I’m a wizard, who needs Gale? (You can romance all of these weirdos too, sex scenes and all.) The combat and social portions of the game weave into one another well, though if you’ve never played a Larian game, don’t have much D&D knowledge or haven’t spent time with tactical turn-based RPGs the battle portions might prove difficult early on. Knowledge in any of those categories should be more than enough to make for an enjoyable challenge that isn’t too frustrating (yet, from my experience). Baldur’s Gate 3 does an excellent job of letting you create your own custom character, but you also have the option of playing a companion character with a pre-written plot and a pre-selected class and background. If you opt to make a custom character and play the normal way (or opt for the “dark urge” plot playthrough — a particularly harrowing, horror-esque alternative story option) you’ll be making a character from scratch. The game was built onto an adapted version of D&D’s current ruleset, offering all of the same class options, many of the race options (elf, half-orc, human, etc.) and even the core set of subclasses. All of that choice means that there are many ways to play, and because you’ll be partied up with three other companions with their own race and class combos, anything you pick should work well. As a D&D player, controlling my whole group is a surprisingly fun way to learn the martial classes that I rarely play as someone who sticks to magic casters like wizards and clerics. The choices you make early have a huge impact on how you’ll play Baldur’s Gate 3, much like they do in a real D&D game. A barbarian is a strong front-line fighter, but not much of a smooth talker. A bard can heal and cast support spells, talking your party out of trouble as the need arises. A wizard knows a lot about the arcane inner workings of the world, all while collecting scrolls of every spell the game has to offer. Meet my wife. Because I like complexity and am currently playing one in my own campaign, I opted to start my playthrough as a wizard. Knowing that Divinity: Original Sin II handsomely rewarded stealth and pickpocketing, I also boosted those skills — not a traditional wizardly archetype. Multiclassing is also more open in the game than a real D&D campaign and you can pay to change your class build on the fly, two great game design choices that mean you’ll be encouraged to experiment. There’s little reason to choose an optimized build over something fun, though I’d recommend boosting charisma for social skills and keeping someone sneaky around to maximize in-game antics. By taking the Friends cantrip (a low-level spell that can be cast for free), I can give myself advantage when I need to talk my way in or out of somewhere, lie outright, or persuade an NPC to my way of thinking. The game does a wonderful job of simulating a real D&D game when your character faces in-game challenges, allowing you to roll dice and add any relevant perks you have (like Friends, or Guidance — another essential cantrip) to sweeten the roll. The sound design in this portion of the game is perfect and after 20-plus hours I’m still not tired of listening to the virtual dice clatter around, deciding my fate. For my magic heavy playstyle, the most exciting thing about Baldur’s Gate 3 is that the game offers most of the same spells as D&D, laying out a vast toolkit of custom solutions for the challenges that will crop up across more than 100 hours of content (that’s 100 hours for a single playthrough — this is a very replayable game, by design). Real-life logic often applies in-game and if you can think up a clever way something might work, the game is usually happy to reward you. Going into the game, I was worried that the map wouldn’t provide enough freedom and exploration but Baldur’s Gate 3 has proven me wrong at every turn. What seems like a straightforward ground-level map in the early hours continues to unfold and unfurl, proving much more complex and interconnected than I could have hoped. Secret areas offer rewards behind locked doors and around sandy inlets, and each of the game’s hidden pockets make exploration worthwhile. There’s no filler here. It’s remarkable, at least in Act 1, that the map hints at a FromSoftware-like approach to interconnectedness. I won’t give too much away, but after discovering a massive underground area, I realized that a completely missable (though incredible!) optional boss fight I did in a swamp earlier actually concealed a secret portal into that zone, which I only entered hours later from a completely different corner of the map. Baldur’s Gate 3 will never hold your hand — you can outright miss huge areas, characters and side stories — so when you do make a big discovery, it’s so much more meaningful than in a normal game that’s left giant breadcrumbs trailing toward all of its secrets. Baldur’s Gate 3 is PC-only for now and it’s already shattering records. With more than 800,000 people playing simultaneously over the weekend, it’s already cracked Steam’s all-time top ten chart. The PlayStation 5 launch next month will drum up even more interest and hopefully anyone who’s considered giving this game a try gives it a shot. So far from my experience, the game plays like a dream on extreme settings, even on my mid-range custom PC (my rig packs a pretty high end CPU but only a 1660 Super for graphics thanks to the 2020 era GPU shortage). I’ve run into plenty of bugs so far but nothing game breaking, and hopefully those will get smoothed out in time. Until then, quick save is your unsung 5th party member. To be clear, Baldur’s Gate 3 is an incredible achievement in gaming — an unlikely hit that combines old-school computer RPG gameplay with Dungeons & Dragons’ current cultural cachet and beautiful high-end graphics to push the bar higher for an entire industry. Even if Larian doesn’t stick the landing (or the later acts lag like they did in Divinity: Original Sin II), I can’t imagine anything tanking my opinion in the next 60+ hours. Like some of the other best games of the last few years — Tears of the Kingdom and Elden Ring spring to mind — Baldur’s Gate 3 makes players feel clever, stoking their imaginations and inspiring a great sense of wonder at a massive game world come to life, in this case with Dungeons & Dragons’ dragons, drow and all."

Is BaaS the outlier?,"It’s been a roller-coaster ride for the banking-as-a-service sector over the last year, with a host of mergers and acquisitions and layoffs. On the other hand, large companies are eagerly adopting the concept to get competitive advantages and to drive value for customers. BaaS can refer to three different parts of the industry: One is the classic of offering bank-like services to other players in the industry, a second is providing the charter and bank services but not doing the underwriting, and a third is banking components, which is more of a fintech, that isn’t a bank, providing bank-like services without a charter. “I believe [banking-as-a-service] is a potentially phenomenal growth space for banks to go after,” Accenture’s global banking lead, Michael Abbott, told TechCrunch+. “There’s already tried-and-true models out there, like private label and co-branding. You’re providing that banking capability, consumer lending and credit card portfolios to consumers, small businesses and increasingly at the corporate level.” And it is a big market. Banking-as-a-service is expected to grow 15% each year to be valued at nearly $66 billion by 2030. Companies continue to attract venture capital, too. This year, Treasury Prime secured $40 million in Series C funding and Synctera raised $15 million to launch embedded products in Canada. Meanwhile, Omnio raised $9.8 million, and U.K.-based bank Griffin raised $13.5 million in June. But it hasn’t all been rosy. Synapse and Figure Technologies were among the first to hold layoffs; Synapse laid off 18% of its employees in June, and Figure Technologies, which includes Figure Pay, laid off 90 people — or about 20% of its workforce — in July. BaaS involves a lot of facets and can be quite confusing, so to make sense of what’s going on, we sat down with people representing BaaS companies, fintech experts and investors to chat about the sector and where it goes from here. While BaaS companies were the recipient of aggressive venture capital infusions in 2020 and 2021, in the last six to 12 months, there was “a recognition or a rationalization of those investments,” Synctera CEO Peter Hazlehurst told TechCrunch+. Around two dozen companies in this sector were funded during those two years, and perhaps a half dozen are still operating today. So how did that happen? According to Hazlehurst, the answer is pretty simple. “They used venture dollars to make irresistible deals to customers to get usage,” he said. “Twelve months ago, we were losing deals because we wouldn’t sign someone up for free. The challenge was the actual market price of that transaction was underwater.” "

Editorial Manager, TechCrunch+ Image Credits: virtualphoto (opens in a new window) / Getty Images Customer acquisition costs are top of mind for every startup, but B2C fintechs operate in an intensely competitive environment as they try to differentiate their offerings. To find tactics that helped companies break through, Ian Sherman, director of growth and value creation at Sagard, surveyed fintechs between seed stage and Series D to track how they managed their marketing budgets over time. “Amid the barrage of marketing channels available, the mantra for B2C fintechs is ‘less is more,’ and our evidence-based research supports this approach,” he writes. Image Credits: Boris Zhitkov / Getty Images According to Crunchbase, web3 startups raised $3.6 billion in the first half of 2023. Given that funding is down 78% from the same period last year, Jacquelyn Melinek asked several investors about how startups should proceed — and adjust their expectations. “If you are down to just two to three months, you’re out of options,” advised Kelly Brewster, CEO of bitcoin-focused accelerator Wolf. “You should pay employees severance, [your remaining] tax bill, and shut down the company. Or, you may find yourself in a bad situation.” Image Credits: Anton Petrus (opens in a new window) / Getty Images Investors poured $7 billion into robotics startups last year, a 15% year-over-year increase that reflects how automation is quickly gaining ground across multiple sectors.

2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/cyber-security-review-board-microsoft-hack-government-emails/,TechCrunch,US cyber board to investigate Microsoft hack of government emails,"A U.S. review board tasked with investigating major cybersecurity incidents said it will begin looking at the recent intrusion of U.S. government email systems provided by Microsoft, whose handling of the incident drew ire and scrutiny from federal lawmakers and the wider security community. The Cyber Security Review Board, or CSRB, said Friday that its latest investigation will include a “broader review of issues relating to cloud-based identity and authentication infrastructure.” The board said it began considering an investigation after learning of the Microsoft cloud breach, which saw China state-backed hackers break into government email accounts, including the inbox of U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, several officials at the U.S. State Department, and other organizations not yet publicly named. According to the slow-drip of information about the incident, Microsoft said China-backed hackers stole a sensitive signing key that allowed unauthorized access to enterprise and government email inboxes hosted by the technology giant. That stolen key, coupled with a flaw that Microsoft has since patched, allowed the forging of authentication tokens that the hackers used to access the target’s email accounts as if they were the rightful owners. The intrusions began in mid-May but were not detected until a month later, when State Department officials detected the breach and notified Microsoft. It was only because the State Department used a higher-paid tier account that allowed access to logs that Microsoft keeps, which first revealed the hacks. Other departments with a lower paid tier were not given access to logs that may have spotted the intrusions sooner. Following criticism, Microsoft capitulated soon after, saying it would make logs available for customers at no additional cost from September. Ron Wyden, a Democratic lawmaker on the Senate Intelligence Committee, blasted Microsoft in a scathing letter to government agencies requesting an investigation into whether “lax cybersecurity practices” enabled Chinese hackers to spy on high-ranking federal government officials. Wyden also called on the CSRB to investigate the incident. In carrying out a post-mortem of the hack, Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in remarks it was “imperative” to understand the vulnerabilities in cloud technologies that are relied on by U.S. organizations. “Actionable recommendations from the CSRB will help all organizations better secure their data and further cyber resilience,” said Mayorkas. This is the CSRB’s third investigation since it was founded by executive order in 2021 by President Biden. The board, which includes representatives from government and cybersecurity experts in the private sector, serves to review major cybersecurity events and identify recommendations to prevent future incidents. The CSRB’s first investigation looked at the fallout from the Log4j vulnerability in 2020, and its second — published this week — examined recent attacks by the Lapsus$ hacking group,"
2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/moveit-mass-hacks-lessons/,TechCrunch,The MOVEit mass hacks hold a valuable lesson for the software industry,"The MOVEit mass hacks will likely go down in history as one of the largest and most successful cyberattacks of all time. By exploiting a vulnerability in Progress Software’s MOVEit managed file transfer service, used by thousands of organizations to securely transfer large amounts of often-sensitive files, hackers were able to inject SQL commands and access customers’ sensitive data. The attack exploited a zero-day vulnerability, which meant Progress was unaware of the flaw and did not have time to patch it in time, leaving its customers largely defenseless. The Russia-linked Clop ransomware group, which claimed responsibility for the hacks, has been publicly listing alleged victims since June 14. This growing list includes banks, hospitals, hotels, energy giants and more, and is part of an attempt to pressure victims into paying a ransom demand to stop their data from spilling online. In a post this week, Clop said that on August 15, it would leak  the “secrets and data” of all MOVEit victims that refused to negotiate. This wasn’t Clop’s first mass hack, either; the group has been blamed for similar hacks targeting Fortra and Acellion’s file-transfer tools. According to Emsisoft’s latest statistics, the MOVEit hack has affected at least 620 known corporates and more than 40 million individuals. Those figures have increased almost daily since the hacks began. But how high could the numbers go? “It’s impossible to assess at this point,” Brett Callow, a ransomware expert and threat analyst at Emsisoft, told TechCrunch+. “We don’t yet know how many organizations were impacted or what data was compromised.” Callow pointed out that around a third of the known victims were impacted via third parties, and others were compromised via subcontractors, contractors or vendors. “This complexity means it’s highly likely that some organizations that have been impacted don’t yet know they’ve been impacted,” he said. While the impact of this hack is unusual because of its scale, the attack isn’t new in terms of its approach. Adversaries have long exploited zero-day flaws, and supply chain attacks have grown prevalent in recent years because one exploit can potentially affect hundreds, if not thousands, of customers. This means that organizations need to act now to ensure they don’t fall victim to the next mass hack. For victims of the hacks, it may seem like the damage has already been done and recovery is impossible. But while recovering from an incident like this can take months or years, affected organizations need to act fast to understand not only what types of data were compromised, but also their potential violations of compliance standards or data privacy laws.

2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/elon-musk-twitter-everything-you-need-to-know/,TechCrunch,"Elon Musk’s Twitter (now X): Everything you need to know, from layoffs to verification","Welcome to Elon Musk’s Twitter (now X), where the rules are made up and the check marks don’t matter. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO first announced his bid to buy Twitter in April 2022, zealously driven to rid the platform of spam bots and protect free speech. “This is just my strong, intuitive sense that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” Musk said at a TED conference on the day he made his offer. “I don’t care about the economics at all.” Even for one of the richest men in the world, $44 billion is a lot of money to cough up to buy a middling social platform. Despite his fervent declarations about expanding “the scope and scale of consciousness” through public discourse, the billionaire got cold feet. A month later in May, he tried to kill the deal, claiming that Twitter had more bots than its public filings let on. After a truly chaotic legal discovery process, which even included some embarrassing texts, Musk was forced to seal the deal. By October, the platform was his. Since Musk bought Twitter and took the company private, the news around the microblogging platform has been a whirlwind, rife with verification chaos, API access shakeups, ban reversals, staggering layoffs, and most notably, rebranding to X. Musk also transitioned from his role as Twitter (X) CEO to serving as its executive chair and CTO. It was announced on May 12 that Linda Yaccarino will step in as the next X CEO. Yaccarino will be leaving her role as chairman of Global Advertising & Partnerships at NBCU. The company said that creators who have garnered 5 million impressions in the last three months will be eligible for ad revenue sharing. That requirement was previously set to 15 million impressions. Creators will be able to withdraw as low as $10 instead of $50, X said. Users still need to be verified and must have at least 500 followers to qualify for payouts. “I’ve been at the company eight weeks,” Yaccarino said in her first broadcast interview since taking on her new role. “The operational run rate right now… we’re pretty close to break even.” “Our data licensing and API with X is an incredible business. Our new subscription business [is] growing,” Yaccarino said. “And then, part of my, what I would say, expertise and experience, and what I came to do, was to drive advertising at the company.” CEO Linda Yaccarino confirmed in her first TV interview that video calls will be a new feature coming to the service, as part of its transformation into an “everything app.” The partnership began in January to tell advertisers if their ad is placed around inappropriate content. Now, X is testing sensitivity settings, powered by machine learning, that let advertisers choose their thresholds for the kinds of content they want their ads to appear around — and according to a tweet from X owner Elon Musk, advertisers can buy these less desirable, “relaxed” sensitivity ad slots for less. Brands can reduce adjacency to gore, excessive profanity and obscenity, targeted hate speech, sexual content, drugs and spam. Soon, X will add its “relaxed” setting, which offers cheaper advertising opportunities while only filtering for targeted hate speech and explicit sexual content. The @music account was originally operated for 16 years by software developer Jeremy Vaught, who grew the @music handle to roughly half a million followers. Vaught posted in anger that X had commandeered the account for itself. “Super pissed,” Vaught wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of the email X had sent him informing him of the change. The feature historically provided information to users about why they were seeing a fact check appended to a tweet. After three years of development, the company says this extra context will now be removed for those who are already experienced with Community Notes. The company has adopted the @Pro handle instead of @TweetDeck for the tool. However, many parts of the tool, including the help page, still have “Twitter” and “TweetDeck” mentions. Musk hinted at the change a week prior, adding that XPro will come with a “wide range of psy op plugins.” There are no details about what kind of plug-ins those might be. Paid verification was introduced last year with the Twitter Blue relaunch. The service was recently renamed to XBlue during the Twitter rebrand to X. The idea is to help users benefit from subscription features without showing that they are a verified account. The option to hide the checkmark will show up in the “Profile customization” section of account settings. The company has updated the help page for paid subscriptions, saying that even if you hide the checkmark it might be visible in some places. The company didn’t give any further details about those placeholders. Apple typically doesn’t allow developers to name their apps as a single character, but they seemed to have made an exception. X also changed its App Store tagline from “Let’s talk.” to “Blaze Your Glory!!” Musk himself posted a tweet with this tagline without any context. The company announced its “Ads Revenue Sharing” program is now available for eligible creators globally. The program, according to posts by X owner Elon Musk, aims to give out $5 million in the first round of creator payments. The iconic bird logo is officially replaced with ‘X’ after Elon Musk announced the change the weekend of July 22. Notably, Musk x.com now also redirects to twitter.com. Musk also called this an “interim” logo, so we might see another logo change in the future. The app also changed its official handle to @x as part of the ongoing rebranding. The original @Twitter handle is now inactive, and its bio reads, “This account is no longer active. Follow @x for updates.” However, the original owner of the @x handle, Gene X Hwang of the corporate photography and videography studio Orange Photography, confirmed to TechCrunch that the company took over his account without warning or financial compensation, telling him the handle is property of X.  Twitter hasn’t officially announced the job postings feature yet, although some verified organizations have already been able to post job listings under their bios. The job listings take applicants directly to the company’s website, where they can learn more about the position and submit an application. Twitter Notes, the feature that allows Twitter users to publish long-form content, appears to be back on track, according to a post from Twitter owner Elon Musk on Tuesday. Musk confirmed the company’s plans in response to a user’s tweet which claimed the Twitter Notes project had recently been rebranded as “Articles.” On Tuesday, July 18, user @FaustoChou tweeted that Notes had been renamed to Articles, signaling perhaps renewed development efforts on Twitter’s part. His screenshot showed the Notes interface, looking much like it did before, as well as other unlaunched features, like Twitter Coins. Musk replied to the tweet, confirming Twitter’s plans. Twitter will now pay creators for a share of the ad revenue earned from ads served in the replies to their posts. Twitter Blue subscribers who have earned more than 5 million tweet impressions each month for the last 3 months are eligible to join the creator payouts. According to Elon Musk, the first round of creator payouts will total $5 million, and will be cumulative from the month of February onward. These payouts will be delivered via Stripe. Despite the program’s significant payouts, some creators weren’t happy — and took their complaints to Twitter owner Elon Musk. In a series of tweets, Musk addressed creators’ concerns over things like the types of accounts that were eligible for monetization, rate limits and other issues. Starting “as soon as” July 14, Twitter will introduce a new messages setting aimed at reducing spam in DMs by moving messages from Verified users you don’t follow back to your “Message Request” inbox instead of your main inbox. Only messages from people you follow will arrive in your primary inbox going forward. Notably, these changes will also now apply to everyone who has their inboxes open to allow messages from anyone. Before becoming pay-to-play, Twitter verification indicated a person was a public or notable figure of some sort — like a politician, celebrity, athlete, journalist or other well-known individual. By making the Verified blue checkmark accessible to anyone who purchased it, Twitter diluted the value of verification. That apparently escalated to the point that people have become bothered by Verified users spamming their main inbox, when they had set it open to receive DMs from the blue-badged crowd. In other words, Twitter has a Verified user spam problem. Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino is pushing back at reports that Twitter traffic is tanking as a result of the July 5 launch of a new competitor, Instagram Threads. However, on Monday, July 10, users reported that Twitter seems to be selectively blocking links to Threads.net’s website in Twitter searches, making it more difficult for anyone to surface conversations on Threads or locate users’ profiles. Less than 24 hours after Threads launched, the Elon Musk-owned company accused Meta of poaching former Twitter employees to create the new platform. “Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information,” Spiro wrote in the letter, which Semafor shared online. “Twitter reserves all rights, including, but not limited to, the right to seek both civil remedies and injunctive relief without further notice to prevent any further retention, disclosure, or use of its intellectual property by Meta.” After swaths of users were unable to access parts of TweetDeck over the last few days, Twitter started rolling out a new version of the web app to users July 3. The company also added that in 30 days, users will have to be verified to access TweetDeck. This means only Twitter Blue subscribers, verified organizations and some folks who have been gifted verification by Twitter will be able to use TweetDeck come August. Twitter is putting limits to how many tweets its users can read as the social media platform suffers extended outage that has stymied users’ ability to track new posts. Verified account holders can peruse a maximum of 6,000 posts daily, while unverified users must contend with a drastically reduced limit of 600 posts. Newly registered, unverified users face even tighter restrictions with an allowance of a mere 300 posts per day, according to Elon Musk. (He has since increased the limit to 10,000, 1,000 and 500, respectively.) These read limits impacted TweetDeck users in particular, reporting major problems including notifications and entire columns failing to load. If you’re not logged into your Twitter account, or don’t have one, and try to view a tweet, you’ll be presented with a sign-in screen. However, days later, Twitter silently removed the login requirement for viewing tweets. When Twitter started enforcing the login requirement, Musk said that he took these “temporary” measures to prevent data scraping. The company hasn’t made any official announcement about allowing users to view links when you aren’t logged in or given any details on what measures it has taken to stop scraping. The company made the change to its Twitter Blue page today, indicating the limit. An engineer at Twitter, Prachi Poddar, also announced the change by posting a long tweet. The National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA), representing 17 publishers, listed 1,700 songs for which it sent multiple copyright violation notices to Twitter. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Nashville, says that Twitter didn’t take any action against these notices. The publishers’ organization said in the filing that it is seeking fines of up to $150,000 for each violation. The lawsuit alleged that the social network “fuels its business with countless infringing copies of musical ‘compositions, violating Publishers’ and others’ exclusive rights under copyright law.” It added that, unlike its competitors TikTok and Instagram, Twitter hasn’t struck a music licensing deal for the use of copyrighted music. Court documents show that Twitter owes three months’ rent to its Boulder landlord, and a judge has signed off on evicting the tech giant from that office. In May the landlord took it to court, and on May 31 the judge issued an order that the sheriff should assist in the eviction of Twitter within the next 49 days — i.e. before the end of July. The case number is 2023CV30342 in Boulder District Court. As many as 300 employees once worked in Twitter’s Boulder offices, but between layoffs, other firings, and resignations, it is probably less than half of that now. The time limit to edit tweets has increased from 30 minutes to one hour for Blue subscribers, giving users a bigger window to change their tweets and correct any typos. Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino officially started her new gig on Monday, June 5, according to a tweet.  Ella Irwin took over for Yoel Roth, who famously left the company during the early days of Elon Musk’s chaotic Twitter takeover. The latest feature is an effort to put more onus on crowdsourced moderation by allowing users to address scenarios of morphed images or AI-generated images across the platform where the photos are posted. The launches comes days after a fake AI-generated image about an attack on the Pentagon spread quickly as prominent accounts retweeted it. Twitter API Pro for startups gives developers the ability to fetch 1 million tweets per month and post 300,000 tweets per month, and gives them access to the full archive search endpoint. Twitter made changes to its paid plan, allowing subscribers to upload two-hour videos — expanding the previous 60-minute limit. The company also modified its Twitter Blue page and said the video file size limit for paid users is now increased from 2GB to 8GB. While earlier longer video upload was only possible from the web, now it’s also possible through the iOS app. Despite these changes, the maximum quality for upload still remains 1080p. Musk confirmed Yaccarino’s new role in a tweet this morning (May 12), a day after he announced that he had completed his search for a new CEO. “Excited to announce that I’ve a new CEO for X/Twitter,” Musk wrote in a tweet on May 11. “She will be starting in ~6 weeks! My role will transition to being exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops.” Currently, this feature is only available to verified Blue users or accounts associated with verified organizations. Additionally, the encryption feature isn’t compatible with group messages and Twitter doesn’t offer protection against man-in-the-middle attacks. Twitter has introduced a new feature that lets users choose almost any emoji to react to a DM in a conversation. Previously, the company allowed you to react to only the most recent DM with only a select set of emojis. CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the new feature is rolling out with the latest app update. According to recent tweets by owner Elon Musk, Twitter is purging inactive accounts that have had “no activity at all for several years.”  Twitter is thinking about an organizational verification plan that doesn’t cost $1,000 a month. Over the Cinco de Mayo weekend, Elon Musk tweeted that the company is working on a cheaper plan for small businesses, but didn’t give any details about the cost.  Twitter confirmed a security error that made Circle tweets surface publicly. TechCrunch reported the glitch in early April, but the platform confirmed the issue May 5 in an email sent to Twitter Circle users. “In April 2023, a security incident may have allowed users outside of your Twitter Circle to see tweets that should have otherwise been limited to the Circle to which you were posting,” the email said. Twitter claims that the bug has now been fixed, and that the team knows what caused it. Twitter announced on May 2 that it is making its API free for verified government or public-owned services posting about public utility alerts such as weather alerts, transportation information and emergency warnings. This comes a month after the company announced its new API pricing tiers. It doesn’t seem to matter what text you’re adding to your bio — TechCrunch reporter Amanda Silberling added a few spaces, then got her check back for a moment. It even showed up with the old text that designates that she is “notable in government, news, entertainment, or another designated category,” and she did not, in fact, pay for this. But once you refresh the page it disappears. In fact, it’s unclear whether anyone else can even see your check briefly reappear. Twitter was confirmed April 25 as one of 19 major tech platforms subject to centralized oversight by the European Union’s executive starting this fall, when so-called very large online platforms (VLOPs) are expected to be compliant with the Digital Services Act (DSA). But the Commission has not wasted any time warning the Elon Musk-owned social network that things aren’t looking good for staying on the right side of the incoming law. In a pair of tweets, Vera Jourova, the EU’s values and transparency VP, warned of “yet another negative sign” by Twitter — accusing the platform under Musk of “not making digital information space any safer and free from the Kremlin #disinformation & malicious influence”. Twitter said that labels will be shown to both authors and viewers. Usually, these tweets will show text such as “Visibility limited: this Tweet may violate Twitter’s rules against Hateful Conduct.” The app’s enforcement policy says that tweets with such labels will not show up in search results, recommendations or timelines — those tweets will be hidden in both the “For You” and “Following timelines. Additionally, there will be no ads placed adjacent to posts with reduced visibility. Over the April 21st weekend, multiple top accounts (with more than 1 million followers) got their verification marks back. However, many of them, including writer Neil Gaiman, footballer Riyad Mahrez, musician Lil Nas X, actress Janel Parrish Long and British TV presenter Richard Osman said that they didn’t pay for the blue badge. In March, The New York Times reported that Twitter was considering handing out a free verification mark to the top 10,000 brands and companies. It’s not clear if the company is applying the same policy to personal accounts. Twitter has removed “government-funded media” labels on all accounts, from NPR to the Chinese state-affiliated Xinhua News. The app even appears to have deleted its web page explaining the “government-funded media” labels. Several users have posted screenshots of an email reportedly sent by Twitter, which states that starting from April 21, verified checkmarks are required to continue running ads on the platform.  With the legacy checks gone, the app will have verification marks only for paid users and businesses, as well as government entities and officials. Now if a user sees a blue check mark and clicks on it, the label reads: “This account is verified because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue and verified their phone number.” Microsoft is dropping the bird app from its advertising platform starting on April 25, nearly two months after Twitter announced that it will begin charging a minimum of $42,000 per month to users of its API, including enterprises and research institutions. The moves mean users will no longer be able to access their account, or create, schedule or otherwise manage tweets through Microsoft’s free social media management service. Twitter owner Elon Musk threatened to take legal action:  Twitter updated its content moderation guidelines regarding hateful content, removing a policy that prohibited the targeted deadnaming or misgendering of transgender people. Enacted in 2018, the policy explicitly stated that it violated Twitter’s rules to repeatedly and purposefully call a transgender person by the wrong name or pronouns. Twitter plans to “soon” begin adding visible labels on tweets that have been identified as potentially violating its policies, which has impacted their visibility. It did not say when exactly the system would be fully rolled out across its network. Typically, when tweets violate Twitter’s policies, one of the actions the company can take is to limit the reach of those tweets — or something it calls “visibility filtering.” In these scenarios, the tweets remain online but become less discoverable, as they’re excluded from areas like search results, trends, recommended notifications, For You and Following timelines, and more. Historically, the wider public would not necessarily know if a tweet had been moderated in this way. Now Twitter says that will change. Twitter’s new feature will let Blue subscribers post 10,000-character-long posts — as if the social network is trying to compete with a rival newsletter platform. Twitter has also added support for bold and italic text formatting. Long-form writing is also not entirely new. Last June, the company introduced a program called Twitter Notes for select writers. However, that program was shut down under Musk. After taking over the company he also killed newsletter tool Revue, a startup Twitter had acquired in 2021. A PBS spokesperson confirmed to Axios that PBS had “no plans to resume tweeting” after Twitter gave it a murky “government-funded media” label over the weekend. A few other news entities appeared to have followed suit, including the prominent Boston NPR affiliate WBUR, Hawaii Public Radio and LA-based local news source LAist. The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC Australia), Australia’s Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), New Zealand’s public broadcaster RNZ, Sweden’s SR Ekot and SVT, and Catalonia’s TV3.cat a were labeled “government-funded media” weeks later. This expands upon the social network’s Cashtag feature, which provided info about a limited number of stocks and crypto coins through TradingView data. The new partnership with eToro goes beyond just displaying information. It also redirects users to the eToro site where they can engage in trading. If you search for a stock on Twitter, you will see a button saying “View on eToro,” which redirects to the site.  Elon Musk gave a rare interview to an actual reporter late on Tuesday, speaking to BBC reporter James Clayton on Twitter Spaces. During the interview, Clayton pressed Musk on whether his purchase of Twitter was, in the end, something he went through with willingly, or whether it was something he did because the active court case at the time in which Twitter was trying to force him to go through with the sale was going badly. The answer was that Musk did indeed only do the deal because he believed legally, he was going to be forced to do so anyway. This is the “final date,” he said in a tweet. If the move goes through, Twitter will have verification marks only for paid users and businesses, and government entities and officials.  Twitter, Inc. is now called X Corp., according to a court filing in California. Since Twitter is no longer a public company, it does not have to report updates like name changes to the SEC. But in any case, the new name was spotted in an April 4 document related to far-right activist Laura Loomer’s lawsuit against Twitter and Facebook. “Twitter, Inc. has been merged into X Corp. and no longer exists,” the document states. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleged that Twitter has to pay more than $1 million to the former executives for legal bills they incurred while at the company to respond to requests by the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission. Numerous Twitter users reported a bug on April 10 in which Circle tweets are surfacing on the algorithmically generated For You timeline. That means that your supposedly private posts might breach containment to reach an unintended audience, which could quickly spark some uncomfortable situations. TechCrunch has spoken to multiple users who have also experienced this glitch firsthand; many more have reported the glitch in their tweets. Most often, it seems that Circle tweets are being surfaced in the For You timeline to users who follow the poster, but are not in their Circle. Others have reported that their Circle tweets are reaching even further than those who follow them. The Elon Musk-owned platform has resumed surfacing accounts of Vladimir Putin and the Russian Embassy in search results. A former Twitter employee told the publication that this move is likely because of a policy change. Twitter is censoring Substack links by making the posts impossible to reply to, like or retweet. While quote-tweeting works, simply pressing the retweet button surfaces an error message: “Some actions on this Tweet have been disabled by Twitter.” You didn’t hear this from us, but if you link to a Substack via a redirected URL, it seems to post without restrictions. Twitter is rolling out additional features for Blue subscribers including showing 50% of ads in their timeline compared to non-paid users and a visibility boost in search. “As you scroll, you will see approximately twice as many organic or non-promoted Tweets placed in between promoted Tweets or ads. There may be times when there are more or fewer non-promoted Tweets between promoted Tweets,” Twitter’s description of the feature says. While Twitter is claiming to reduce ads on paid subscribers’ feeds, it is hard to prove if they are actually seeing fewer ads apart from anecdotal experiences. NPR’s Twitter account on the platform now comes with a tag denoting it as “US state-affiliated media.” But NPR doesn’t meet Twitter’s own definition for a state-affiliated account:  NPR later announced that it will no longer be posting content to its 52 official Twitter feeds, becoming the first major news organization to go silent on the social media platform. Musk had claimed that starting on April 1, blue checkmarks that previously indicated that an account was legitimate, verified and notable would be maintained only for those who have a subscription to Twitter Blue. The change would be part of a wider push for Twitter to gate previously free features, and bundle new ones, under the $8 per month Twitter Blue subscription, which costs $11 on iOS and Android devices. As numerous celebrities and businesses spoke out to say they wouldn’t pay the $8 fee, it appeared that removing so many blue checks would be easier said than done. Instead, Twitter merely updated the text accompanying a blue check to make it unclear whether someone was verified for being notable, or for paying for Twitter Blue. In an ultimate act of pettiness, Twitter removed The New York Times’ verification check when the news giant said it wouldn’t pay for verification. Based on early returns, the revamped Twitter Blue has yet to contribute significantly to Twitter’s bottom line, with just $11 million generated from mobile signups in its first three months. The three API tiers include a free level meant for content posting bots, a $100/month basic level and a costly enterprise level. Subscribing to any level gets access to the Ads API at no additional cost.  Twitter mentioned that over the next 30 days, the company will discontinue old access levels, including Standard (for v1.1), Essential and Elevated (for v2), and Premium. Developers remain unhappy with Twitter’s new API structure.  Musk justified the move by saying this was the “only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over.”  Twitter decreases the wait to purchase Twitter Blue for newly created Twitter accounts from 90 days to 30 days. “New subscriptions to Twitter Blue are available globally on web, iOS, or Android. Not all features are available on all platforms. Newly created Twitter accounts will not be able to subscribe to Twitter Blue for 30 days. We may also impose waiting periods for new accounts in the future at our discretion, and without notice,” the Twitter Blue page reads. Twitter announced that the removal of legacy blue checkmarks will begin April 1 for users that are not subscribed to Twitter Blue. Elon tweeted back in December that the company will remove legacy checkmarks “in a few months.” After that, users with legacy blue checks had been seeing a pop-up when they clicked on their checkmark, which read, “This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.” But once Twitter botched this removal of checkmarks, they changed the copy again — as of now, users cannot distinguish whether someone has a checkmark because they paid, or because they were deemed notable.  Twitter’s Tor service, a version of the site that could be accessed even in countries where the social network is banned, has gone dark after the company failed to renew its certificate, which expired on March 6. Pavel Zoneff, director of strategic communications at the Tor Project, told TechCrunch that the site “is no longer available seemingly with no plans to renew.” This expansion makes the social network’s subscription service available in more than 35 countries across the world. These countries include Netherlands, Poland, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Romania, Czech Republic, Finland, Denmark, Greece, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Slovakia, Latvia, Slovenia, Estonia, Croatia, Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus. Twitter laid off more than 200 employees in its fourth round of cuts, including loyalist Esther Crawford — the chief executive of Twitter payments who oversaw the company’s Twitter Blue verification subscription. Twitter’s staff is down from about 7,500 employees to less than 2,000 since Musk.  One of the numerous rounds of cuts eliminated the platform’s entire accessibility team. Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) called on Elon Musk to bring the accessibility team back in an open letter. Markey requested a response by March 17. After updating its ad policy on February 15, Twitter became the first social media app in the U.S. to allow cannabis advertising. Cannabis ads will run on Twitter in U.S. states where cannabis is legal and in Canada. The initial date set to cut free access to Twitter’s API was February 9, which was then extended to February 13. Now, the social network has delayed the shutdown again, this time with no date set.  The delay jeopardizes the plans of developers and startups building tools around the Twitter API as they wouldn’t have any clarity on future spending and budget allocation on the developer platform. The company originally planned to shut down free access to its API on February 9. Now it has extended this deadline to February 13. Twitter said that it will charge $100 per month for the basic tier of API. This will get developers access to a “low level of API usage,” as well as the Ads API.  When developers trying to seek clarity around the new API rules went to the developer forum website, they found that the site had been put behind a login. The forum was finally accessible four days later on February 13. Twitter announced the ability to post longer tweets for paid users on February 8. Instead of being limited to 280 characters, paying Blue subscribers can post tweets that are up to 4,000 characters. While only Twitter Blue subscribers can post long tweets, all users will be able to read them. You will see only the first 280 characters on the timeline, and if you want to read more, you can click on “Show more.”  Elon Musk announced in a tweet on February 3 that the company would soon begin sharing advertising revenue with creators on the platform for the first time. He follows up the announcement with a catch: Eligible users must be signed up for Twitter Blue. Payouts have yet to reach creators’ wallets. Twitter Blue subscriptions are now available in Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain, making it 12 regions in total to which users can subscribe to it as of February 2. On February 8, Twitter Blue extended services further to India, Indonesia and Brazil. Twitter also announced launching a new Spaces tab with curated stations for live and recorded spaces, along with podcasts. The social network is making podcasts available only to Blue subscribers and “some people on Twitter for iOS and Twitter for Android apps.” Twitter will discontinue offering free access to the Twitter API starting February 9 and will launch a paid version, Twitter said as it looks for more avenues to monetize the platform.  A week later and days before the February 9 deadline, Elon Musk said that after getting feedback from developers, Twitter will provide a write-only API for “bots providing good content that is free.” Twitter announced February 1 that it is discontinuing CoTweeting, a feature that allowed two users to co-author a tweet. Users will be able to view the set of co-tweets for a month. After that, they will be automatically converted to retweets on the co-author’s profile.  Due to declining ad revenue and advertiser exits, Twitter announced on January 25 that it has teamed up with adtech companies DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science (IAS) to tell advertisers if their ad is placed around inappropriate content. The program, available first for U.S.-based advertising campaigns, allows brands to analyze the content adjacent to — primarily tweets above and below the ad — all types of ads, including promoted tweets. The new design displays the bookmark button under the expanded tweet view, making it easier to add a post to your bookmarks. Before the change, you had to tap on the share button to open the sharing card and then tap on the bookmark option to save a tweet. In addition to the new button, as soon as you tap on the button, you will see a banner at the top of the screen that says “Show all bookmarks.” The option is currently visible only on the iOS app, but we can expect that Twitter will roll this out to Android and the web soon. Image Credits: Twitter After cutting off prominent app makers like Tweetbot and Twitterific, Twitter quietly updated its developer terms to ban third-party clients altogether on January 19. The “restrictions” section of the company’s developer agreement was updated with a clause prohibiting “use or access the Licensed Materials to create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product to the Twitter Applications.” Earlier in the week, the company said that it was “enforcing long-standing API rules” in disallowing clients access to its platform but didn’t cite which specific rules developers were violating. As a result, third-party Twitter clients began offloading their apps from App Stores. Users now have a chance to get a discount for $84/year if they purchase an annual Blue subscription on the web. Twitter Blue, including the new annual plan, is currently available in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Image Credits: Twitter In a strange attempt to make money, Twitter is auctioning off surplus office furniture (auction is now closed) that it doesn’t need anymore, now that thousands of employees have either left the company or been laid off. When you’re rapidly losing advertisers and apparently not paying your rent, why not go for the hail mary? The company has tried to pull this stunt previously, only to give the option to switch back to a chronological timeline after a lot of backlashes. What’s different this time? The Elon Musk-led company is now showing both algorithmic and chronological feeds side-by-side. Users can switch between them by swiping on their phone screens. Until now, users had to tap on the sparkle icon in the top-right corner to switch between the “Home” and “Latest” timelines. Twitter is justifying its latest change by saying that users can now easily swipe between the renamed “For You” and “Following” timelines.  According to social media analyst Matt Navarra, Twitter’s advanced search filters for mobile are coming soon. Here’s what it looks like:  The company originally enforced the ban back in 2019. At that time, it said that “political message reach should be earned, not bought.” Twitter charted a different path from other social networks like Facebook and Instagram, which allowed political ads. The company’s announcement to lift the political ad ban comes at a time when advertisers have been pulling back spending on the platform, and the company has been cutting down its internal revenue projections. On December 23, the Twitter Blue page was updated declaring that subscribers can now upload 60-minute videos from the web at 1080p resolution and 2GB in file size. According to posts on Twitter and LinkedIn from a former public policy employee on December 22, Twitter cut half of its public policy team. The company also laid off some engineers in infrastructure via email on December 16. Across all of Twitter, it’s estimated that about 75% of employees have either chosen to leave or have been laid off since Elon Musk took ownership of the company in October. To access the new feature, users have to just type the dollar symbol followed by the relevant ticker symbol, e.g. “$GOOG” or “$ETH” (minus the quote marks), in the search bar and Twitter will display the current price. This also works without using the $ symbol in some instances, but it’s less consistent and doesn’t always return the stock or crypto prices as requested. If someone wants to know more details about a stock or cryptocurrency, they can hit the “View on Robinhood” button.  A tweet’s View Count will be visible to everyone, not just the owner of the account. “Twitter is rolling out View Count, so you can see how many times a tweet has been seen! This is normal for video,” Elon Musk wrote in a tweet. “Shows how much more alive Twitter is than it may seem, as over 90% of Twitter users read, but don’t tweet, reply or like, as those are public actions.” Twitter’s product manager Esther Crawford said the social media platform is launching a pilot program for Blue for Business with select businesses. The company plans to expand this to more organizations next year.  A day after Twitter crafted a new policy to explain its decision to ban an account that tracks Elon Musk’s private jet, Twitter also suspended its open source competitor Mastodon from the service. Within the same day, Twitter suspended a number of prominent journalists on the platform without warning. “Same doxxing rules apply to ‘journalists’ as to everyone else,” Elon Musk tweeted in a reply about the journalists’ suspensions. The company seemingly had a glitch that allowed banned users to still participate in Twitter Spaces. A group of the banned journalists started a group conversation on Spaces where Musk himself joined in. Shortly after, the app pulled its Spaces group audio feature temporarily. Revue, the newsletter platform acquired by Twitter in January 2021, sent a message to newsletter writers on December 14 declaring, “We’ve made the difficult decision to shut down Revue.” Writers had until January 18, 2023 to retrieve their data before everything was deleted. Twitter dispersed the advisory group consisting of roughly 100 independent researchers and human rights activists from around the world. The council members received an email on Monday, December 12 from the company saying that the Trust & Safety Council is “not the best structure” to get external insights into the company product and policy strategy. Twitter will remove all legacy blue checkmarks “in a few months,” Elon Musk tweeted on December 12. Before Musk bought Twitter, checkmarks were used to verify individuals and entities as active, authentic and notable accounts of interest. This past week, many blue checkmark holders have been seeing a pop-up when they click on their blue checkmark that reads, “This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.” Twitter is officially bringing back the Twitter Blue subscription on December 12, starting in five countries before rapidly expanding to others. The app updated its terms to specify that users will need to verify their phone numbers before purchasing the Twitter Blue subscription. Web sign-ups will cost $8 per month and iOS sign ups will cost $11 per month for “access to subscriber-only features, including the blue checkmark,” per a tweet from the company account. Twitter Blue became available on Android at the same price as iOS in January 2023. In addition to the relaunch of Twitter Blue, the company also began rolling out a new offering called Blue for Business that adds a gold checkmark to company accounts. Community Notes, previously known as Birdwatch, are now visible around the world. Community Notes is the social media giant’s crowdsourced fact-checking system. Moderators who are part of the program can add notes to tweets to add context and users can then vote if they determine the context to be helpful. Prior to this global expansion, Community Notes were only visible to users in the U.S. Twitter added moderators from the U.K., Ireland, Australia and New Zealand in January 2023. When Twitter launched its new subscription plan with a verification mark on November 9, it charged users $7.99 per month. In an attempt to offset App Store fees, the company is charging iOS users $11 for the new subscription plan — though the Twitter Blue plan is on halt. The platform’s crowdsourced fact-checking system, Community Notes, are notes written by users that are appended to tweets to provide further clarification and context. The Community Notes algorithm change involves scoring notes where contributors explain why a tweet shouldn’t be deemed misleading. Elon Musk announces that Twitter will tentatively roll out a new multicolored verification system where companies will get a gold checkmark, government officials will get a grey checkmark and the blue checkmark will be dedicated to individuals even if they are not celebrities. That means the blue checkmark will be used with legacy verified accounts and folks who buy the company’s proposed $8 per month paid plan. If you’re confused about all the checkmarks, you’re not alone. Here’s a quick guide on what each checkmark and badge means. On November 9, CEO Elon Musk floated changes to Twitter’s system for verifying user accounts, including charging $8 per month for it. The social media company seemingly began rolling out a new tier of Twitter Blue, its premium subscription service. According to a tweet by Esther Crawford, a former product lead, the new Twitter Blue plan wasn’t yet live, but some users saw notifications as part of a live test.  The company also launched grey-colored official checkmarks for notable accounts such as companies and politicians. But within hours of the launch, Elon Musk killed it. Crawford clarified that the grey “Official” labels are still going out as part of the new Twitter Blue product. The new $8 Twitter Blue plan began rolling out to iOS users in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K with the only feature available at the time being the blue “verified” checkmark. This caused a number of fake accounts pretending to be celebrities, brands and otherwise influential people to create accounts and spread misinformation. Elon Musk laid off 3,700 people on November 3, almost half its staff, shortly after completing the acquisition. Twitter was sued in a class action lawsuit in response to not giving employees advance notice of a mass layoff, alleging Twitter violated worker protection laws. A week later, the app reached out to some former employees to return as they were laid off “by mistake.” In addition to layoffs, a round of executive departures also swept through the company. In Musk’s first email to his new staff, he talked about ending remote work and making the fight against spam a priority. Twitter begins overhauling a new and more expensive version of Twitter Blue, the platform’s paid plan, that will reportedly cost $19.99 per month and give users a verified badge. At the time, Twitter Blue cost $4.99 per month in the U.S. According to a report from The Verge, the company plans to remove verification badges from current holders if they don’t pay for Twitter Blue within 90 days of launching the new verification system. Elon Musk closed on his $44 billion acquisition of the bird app on October 27, 2022. The deal came after months of legal drama, bad memes and will-they-or-won’t-they-chaos. After sealing the deal, Musk took Twitter private and began clearing house. On day one, he fired former CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, general counsel Sean Edgett and head of Legal, Trust and Safety Vijaya Gadde."
2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/instagram-will-now-let-you-add-music-to-photo-carousels/,TechCrunch,Instagram will now let you add music to photo carousels,"Does a photo still remain a photo when you add a music track to it? Hard to tell. Instagram said today that it will allow users to add music to their photo carousels in order to let them show off their musical taste. The company has partnered with pop star Olivia Rodrigo, who showed off this feature on her account with a photo carousel along with her new single “bad idea right?” The new feature follows another music-related offering in June when the social network rolled out a way to let people share a clip of a track they are listening to through Instagram Notes. Instagram is also today launching a way for more people to collaborate on a post or a Reel. The company said that users can now invite up to three friends as co-authors. It added that the post or the Reel with multiple collaborators will reach each of their audiences. The social network first launched the “Collabs” feature in 2021 after a small-scale global test. Instagram now lets you add up to three collaborators to your post Image Credits: Instagram In addition, the social network updated its “Add Yours” sticker feature first launched in 2021 to now prompt users to participate in a challenge or a hashtag. With this, creators can highlight some of the Reels from their fans. Other users will be able to see those Reels — highlighted with a “Creator pick” tag — when they tap on the creator’s “Add Yours” stickers. Users will also see a text on top of the “Add Yours” page that reads: “Create a Reel with this prompt for a chance to be chosen as a creator pick.” Creators can pick up to 10 Reels related to that specific sticker, the company notes. Users whose posts are picked by creators will get a notification, as well. Image Credits: Instagram Meta has been trying different things for making people engage with Reels more often. Reels have hit 200 billion daily plays and have crossed the revenue run rate of $10 billion, Mark Zuckerberg said last month during the company’s Q2 2023 earnings call. The company is trying to change media consumption on Instagram, as well. Last year, the social network started focusing more on video. In June, it declared “Video posts are now shared as Reels.” After backlash from users like Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, in a video Reel, Instagram’s head Adam Mosseri said that “We’re going to continue to support photos. It’s part of our heritage.” However, Instagram has been moving away from its “photo-sharing app” image for a long time. The latest move to include music with photos is another way for the company to experiment with multimedia posts."
2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/sample-series-b-pitch-deck-anybotics-ag/,TechCrunch,Pitch Deck Teardown: ANYbotics’ $50M Series B deck,"Earlier this year, Brian wrote about ANYbotics’ $50 million Series B fundraise, which made me realize it’s been a hot minute since I’ve done a robotics teardown. That changes today, since ANYbotics was kind enough to share its pitch deck so we could take a closer look at the highs and lows of four-legged ‘bots. Since the startup claims it has $150 million in preorders/reservations from gas, oil and chemical companies, and the fact that this is a growth round, I know this is going to be a traction-forward pitch. But there are many ways to weave that narrative. Let’s see how ANYbotics decided to carve that particular turkey. We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.  ANYbotics sent through a lightly redacted deck that only blurs customer logos and financials. Here are the slides: ANYbotics is a pretty cool company, and I’m always curious how any robotics company tells its story vis-à-vis the Goliath in the room: Boston Dynamics. This is the name that usually springs to mind when it comes to four-legged robots. ANYbotics does a great job on some fronts, though. Here are three things I loved about the pitch. [Slide 4] Nothing is inevitable, but this is a very compelling story. Image Credits: ANYboticsExperienced robotics investors won’t truly need this slide, but ANYbotics is shrewd to include it. Investment decisions are rarely made in a vacuum, and in a VC firm, a broader partnership usually must be convinced of the viability of an investment. Slides like this can do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to telling the story. This slide tells investors something they already know: Manufacturing robots have been around for a long time, warehousing robots are just finding their stride, and the market is ready for the next step of the evolution. Framing the story of robotics as a journey from structured tasks to structured environments and then to structured problems was an elegant choice, and by outlining the history, the company is already hinting at the problem space and the benefits to customers. It’s a pretty subtle and masterful stroke of storytelling. Startups should learn from this to contextualize their product in the market. Why are you doing what you do? What came before? How can you extrapolate existing markets and products to show how your company can be successful? Is there any way you can tell the story of your market like ANYbotics did here? [Slide 9] That’s a lot of use cases. Image Credits: ANYboticsIf this slide had shown up in an early-stage deck, I’d have lambasted the company for a complete lack of focus. But this isn’t a pre-product company hand-waving and saying, “Eh, there’s tons of opportunities, I guess.” This is a company raising $50 million to spur growth. Assuming ANYbotics has a solid go-to-market strategy for each of these value propositions, this slide communicates the utility of autonomous, all-purpose robots that can be used in a ton of situations where not employing a robot can be costly, pose safety risks, or both. Also: Including the value propositions in the slide helps bring the size of the market to life and illustrate some of the growth opportunities. I’d have loved to see a slide about the pipeline for selling to these customers to go with this one, but it’s possible that some of that information is on the redacted slides. But as a startup, if you’re saying pretty much everyone could be your customer, you’d best be prepared to back it up and explain how you’re going to reach “everyone.” Forgive the meme, but I wanted to share this heavily redacted slide and what I noticed: [Slide 10] Expo-bloody-nential for the win. Image Credits: ANYboticsAs expected, ANYbotics raised this growth round based on beefy traction. Look at the monthly and total operating income graph on the top right: Over the course of its history, the company has seen fits and bursts of sales and income, but things went a little silly in the last 20% of the graph.

			You have strong traction and a way to continue that traction. Where do I send my investment check?

 I would have told this story differently. Instead of cramming this slide with logos and sales partners, I’d have featured the sales order history upfront and backed it up with some way of showing that the exponential growth isn’t a fluke, but the result of a repeatable sales approach. When you tell the story that way, it almost doesn’t matter what the rest of the deck says. You have strong traction and a way to continue that traction. I expect that ANYbotics goes into more detail on this front on slide 16, and if I were a potential investor, I’d find myself asking a very important question: Where do I send my investment check? In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things ANYbotics could have improved or done differently, along with the company’s full pitch deck! An important part of raising growth funding is showing how you’re going to achieve that growth. Unfortunately, and perhaps understandably, the company redacted some of the slides that help us get the full picture of that growth (slide 17, in particular). Still, reading between and around the lines, I can spot some things that might benefit from a tuneup. "
2023-08-11,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/google-pushes-match-for-more-money-in-antitrust-battle-court-filing-states/,TechCrunch,"Google pushes Match for more money in antitrust battle, court filing states","Google has filed a new motion to the court in its antitrust battle with Epic Games and Match Group, where it claims that the dating app maker owes additional fees beyond the $40 million that had been previously set aside in escrow. Those funds are Google’s cut of Match’s in-app payments on Google Play that Match argues are “illegal under federal and state law” — something the court case will decide. By Google’s calculations, the new figure should total around $84 million instead, based on Match’s public earnings. The relevant portion of the filing reads as follows: The escrow account was one of a handful of concessions from Google to get Match to drop a temporary restraining order it filed after first suing Google, accusing the tech giant of wielding unfair monopoly power in its mobile app marketplace, the Google Play Store. Google also committed to not rejecting or deleting Match-owned dating apps like Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid and others from the Play Store for providing alternative payment options. As part of this agreement, Match was to place up to $40 million in the escrow account in lieu of paying fees directly to Google for the in-app payments that take place outside of Google Play’s own payment system while the courts decide whether or not the commissions Google charges app developers on in-app purchases are legal. But in the new filing, Google argues $40 million is not enough, citing Match’s public earnings. It points to the dating app maker’s shareholder letter for Q2 2022 where the company notes that “While our Q2 Adjusted Operating Income outlook includes an estimated $6 million of negative impact from Google’s policy change beginning June 1st, we need to see the actual effects once the change is implemented.” Google says that $6 million is what Match owes in fees, but the lawsuit paused the payments. Based on this figure, Google estimates Match owes fees of $6 million per month for the past 14 months, which would total $84 million in fees. That exceeds the $40 million held in escrow, so Google is now planning to try to recover a higher amount in its counterclaims. “While those payments have now ended, the service fees that Match owes Google substantially exceed that amount,” the filing explains. “Google intends to try its counterclaims to recover the full amount it is owed.” Match declined to comment."

The reality is that it usually takes many on-target goals to scale through every additional million, and these do not get any easier. I’ve worked diligently to not only keep track of all the lessons I learned while scaling my startup that I co-founded two years ago, but also to share them with you. In a previous article, I discussed what I learned during my $0 to $1 million ARR journey. This one will be no different. While it may seem that not much changes between each successive million, you would be surprised at the mistakes one can make in this latest stage of startup growth. I’ll share why hiring earlier is frequently better, why consistently allocating 10% of revenue to marketing throughout your expansion is key, and the importance of strategic partnerships. Apart from select software startups, it is no secret that as you scale up, it becomes necessary to increase your staffing levels. I learned this lesson during my own startup experience and unfortunately made key hires too late, leading to stagnation in our growth as the team quickly became inundated with too much work. You must keep track of everyone on your team and their bandwidth consistently during the high-growth stages, because workloads can vary dramatically month to month, and even week to week. At my startup, we weren’t doing this. Some individuals on the team were assigned tasks that should have realistically been shared by at least three employees, which inevitably led to errors and lost clients.

The moment we made hires for our C-suite was the moment we began to break through numerous plateaus of growth, as their experience pushed us forward. When possible, make these key strategic hires sooner than you might otherwise realistically think you need to. As a gauge on hiring for your team, ask yourself the following two questions: As our CMO, the budgeting for our marketing team falls directly under my domain. I am a firm believer that 10% of net revenue should be applied directly to marketing expenses. This includes paid acquisition spends, influencer deals, blog content writing and tools. In B2B specifically, if you constantly spend the same amount while revenue is increasing and everything else stays equal, you won’t have enough volume to support the sales team. For example, we spent the same amount for six straight months, even though our revenues had increased 50%, leaving our sales team with the same lead volume. We expected to continue driving more closed deals, but that was a huge misconception as marketing spend stayed the same. Percentage of marketing spend should move at the same rate as revenue.

2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/x-formerly-twitter-lowers-requirements-for-its-ad-revenue-sharing-program/,TechCrunch,"X, formerly Twitter, lowers requirements for its ad-revenue sharing program…with a catch","Elon Musk–owned social network X, formerly Twitter, said late Thursday that it is lowering requirements for its creator payout program. The company said that the creators who have garnered 5 million impressions in the last three months will be eligible for ad revenue sharing — a third of the previous 15 million impression requirement. Creators will be able to withdraw as low as $10 instead of $50, the company said. Users still need to be verified and must have at least 500 followers to qualify for payouts. Shortly after the announcement, Musk added a stipulation, stating that only impressions from verified accounts would be considered for ad-revenue sharing. “Scammers will otherwise use bots to spam views to infinity,” he cautioned. This change will significantly reduce the pool of money available to creators through this program, however. Currently, X doesn’t offer its users a way to check their posts’ “verified views.” It is unclear how creators will be able to find how many views or impressions their posts received from verified users. The company started paying some eligible creators in July, and later in the month, it opened up the program to verified creators globally. Musk said in June that the first block of creator payouts will amount to nearly $5 million. X said last week that due to a surge in sign-ups, the scheduled payout for July 31 experienced a delay. Earlier in the week, X announced new sensitivity settings for advertisers to let them choose levels like “Relaxed,” “Standard,” and “Conservative.” These levels will decide what kind of content can appear adjacent to their ads. This is an expansion of the social media company’s partnership with Integral Ad Science (IAS), which it started working with in January to tell marketers if their ad is placed around inappropriate content. On Thursday, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a Spaces conversation that the company is close to “breakeven.” In her first interview after taking over the executive seat at the company, Yaccarino also revealed that X was working on a feature to let users video call each other."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/cruise-and-waymo-win-robotaxi-expansions-in-san-francisco/,TechCrunch,Cruise and Waymo win robotaxi expansions in San Francisco,"In a win for the autonomous vehicle industry, California regulators have given the green light to Cruise and Waymo to offer commercial robotaxi services across San Francisco 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The commission voted 3-1 in support of the expansions; Commissioner Genevieve Shiroma cast the sole “no” vote. The California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) votes in favor of the AV companies come in spite of mounting opposition from residents and city agencies that have urged caution and a more incremental approach to expansion. Since AVs hit the streets of San Francisco, there have been numerous instances of vehicles malfunctioning and stopping in the middle of the street — referred to as “bricking” — blocking the flow of traffic, public transit and emergency responders. Cruise and Waymo both offer limited paid services in San Francisco — Cruise charges for driverless rides at night, and Waymo charges for its robotaxi service throughout the city at any time of day, but with a human safety operator present. The permit extension allows the companies to expand their services significantly and with no limit on the number of robotaxis they can put on the roads. While Cruise and Waymo have both said they would expand incrementally, and not all at once, scale is vital for the companies’ success. Developing, testing and deploying AV tech has cost Cruise and Waymo millions of dollars. Waymo has had to pull back on operations this year after Alphabet issued a slew of layoffs in the first quarter. In July, the company shut down its self-driving trucks program to shift all its available resources to ride-hailing. If either Waymo of Cruise are to get a return on their investments, they need to grow exponentially in San Francisco and beyond. The CPUC ended up voting to grant the permit expansions because it did not anticipate the robotaxi services to result in significant safety risks. The agency’s primary role is to promote the public interest by ensuring safe, reliable and affordable utility services. As long as Cruise and Waymo’s services meet those requirements, the CPUC doesn’t have the authority to limit them. Many who spoke during the public comment period at the CPUC’s hearing called out the companies for not deploying robotaxis that are Americans with Disabilities Act compliant. They asked the CPUC to require clearer guidelines for companies to become ADA-compliant. “Can driverless vehicles assist passengers who need escorting to and from the vehicle?,” said Laura Massey, a member of San Francisco’s Paratransit Coordinating Council. “Can they load and secure mobility aids like wheelchairs and walkers? Can a driverless car spot a blind passenger waiting? Can it call out to that blind passenger that it has arrived to pick them up?” Others expressed concerns that Waymo and Cruise discriminate against the unbanked and those who aren’t digitally literate; would only add thousands of more cars to streets that should be focusing more on micromobility; and are taking away jobs in a city that is suffering from increasing levels of homelessness. A handful of taxi and ride-hail drivers spoke at the hearing saying they were fearful of losing their jobs and being unable to support their families if robotaxis prevailed. Callers critical of autonomous vehicles also citied CPUC Commissioner John Reynolds‘ past role as “Managing Counsel at Cruise” as a conflict of interest. Many of the public comments in favor of the applications to expand AV ride-hailing came from those representing the interests of people who are blind. “When I get into a Waymo vehicle, I feel not only that I’m able to get to where I need to be on my own terms, which is huge, but I’m able to do so without the fear of being harassed, groped, assaulted or attacked,” said Jessie Wollensky, who identified as a blind woman. Other public comments in favor called on residents not to fear technological progress and pointed out that AVs could make streets safer and greener. Some people representing unions like Local 87 said they believed Cruise and Waymo would bring more unionized jobs to the city. Daniel Gregorski, 27, one of Cruise’s beta testers, told TechCrunch he was excited about the permit expansion. He works as a nurse assistant at night and finds the experience of riding in an autonomous vehicle to be safer than riding in a taxi. “People like me who get off at 1am who still need to keep that heightened amount of safety when you’re with a human Uber driver,” said Gregorski. “Being with a robot driver, I feel a little bit safer. I’m in control of the music, the temperature, so I could truly feel comfortable during my ride.” The companies fought hard for their win. Cruise in particular went on the offensive in recent months. The company took out full-page ads in major newspapers across the U.S. claiming humans are terrible drivers and robotaxis could save lives. Cruise also launched a petition this week, urging the CPUC to grant its permit expansion, and has amassed 2,600 signatures."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/hidden-forces-and-sliding-screens-trick-the-senses-to-make-vr-feel-more-real/,TechCrunch,Hidden forces and sliding screens trick the senses to make VR feel more real,"The next big thing in VR might not be higher resolution or more immersive sound, but an experience augmented by physical sensations or moving parts that fool your senses into mistaking virtual for reality. Researchers at SIGGRAPH, from Meta to international student groups, flaunted their latest attempts to make VR and AR more convincing. The conference on computer graphics and associated domains is taking place this week in Los Angeles, and everyone from Meta to Epic to universities and movie studios were demonstrating their wares. It’s the 50th SIGGRAPH, so a disproportionate amount of the event was dedicated to retrospectives and such like, though the expo hall was full of the latest VFX, virtual production, and motion capture hardware and software. In the “emerging technologies” hall, or cave as the darkened, black-draped room felt, dozens of experimental approaches at the frontiers of VR seemed to describe the state of the art: visually impressive, but with immersion relying almost entirely on that. What could be done to make the illusion more complete? For many, the answer lies not in the virtual world with better sound or graphics, but in the physical one. Meta was a large presence in the room, with its first demonstration of two experimental headsets, dubbed Butterscotch and Flamera. Flamera takes an interesting approach to “passthrough” video, but it’s Butterscotch’s “varifocal” approach that really changes things in the virtual world. VR headsets generally comprise a pair of tiny, high-resolution displays fixed to a stack of lenses that make them appear to fill the wearer’s field of vision. This works fairly well, as anyone who has tried a recent headset can attest. But there’s a shortcoming in the simple fact that moving things closer doesn’t really allow you to see them better. They remain at the same resolution, and while you might be able to make out a little more, it’s not like picking up an object and inspecting it closely in real life. Meta’s Butterscotch prototype headset, in pieces. Meta’s Butterscotch prototype, which I tested and grilled the researchers about, replicates that experience by tracking your gaze within the headset, and when your gaze falls on something closer, physically sliding the displays closer to your eyes. The result is shocking to anyone who has gotten used to the poor approximation of “looking up close” at something in VR. The display only moves over a span of about 14 millimeters, a researcher at the Meta booth told me, and that’s more than enough at that range not just to create a clearer image of the up-close item — remarkably clear, I must say — but to allow the eyes to more naturally change their “accommodation” and “convergence,” the ways they naturally track and focus on objects.  While the process worked extremely well for me, it totally failed for one attendee (whom I suspect was a higher-up at Sony’s VR division, but his experience seemed genuine) who said that the optical approach was at odds with his own vision impairment, and turning the feature on actually made everything look worse. It’s an experiment, after all, and others I spoke to found it more compelling. Sadly the shifting displays may be somewhat impractical on a consumer model, making the feature quite unlikely to come to Quest any time soon. Elsewhere on the demo floor, others are testing far more outlandish physical methods of fooling your perception. One from Sony researchers takes the concept of a rumble pack to extremes: a controller mounted to a sort of baton, inside which is a weight that can be driven up and down by motors to change the center of gravity or simulate motion.  In keeping with the other haptic experiments I tried, it doesn’t feel like much outside of the context of VR, but when paired with a visual stimulus it’s highly convincing. A rapid-fire set of demos first had me opening a virtual umbrella — not a game you would play for long, obviously, but an excellent way to show how a change in center of gravity can make a pretend item seem real. The motion of the umbrella opening felt right, and then the weight (at its farthest limit) made it feel like the mass had indeed moved to the end of the handle. Next, a second baton was affixed to the first in perpendicular fashion, forming a gun-like shape, and indeed the demo had me blasting aliens with a shotgun and pistol, each of which had a distinct “feel” due to how they programmed the weights to move and simulate recoil and reloading. Last, I used a virtual light saber on a nearby monster, which provided tactile feedback when the beam made contact. The researcher I spoke to said there are no plans to commercialize it, but that the response has been very positive and they are working on refinements and new applications. An unusual and clever take on this idea of shifting weights was SomatoShift, on display at a booth from University of Tokyo researchers. There I was fitted with a powered wristband, on which two spinning gyros opposed one another, but could have their orientation changed in order to produce a force that either opposed or accelerated the movement of the hand. Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch The mechanism is a bit hard to understand, but spinning weights like this essentially want to remain “upright,” and by changing their orientation relative to gravity or the object on which they are mounted, that tendency to right themselves can produce quite precise force vectors. The technology has been used in satellites for decades, where they are known as “reaction wheels,” and the principle worked here as well, retarding or aiding my hand’s motions as it moved between two buttons. The forces involved are small but perceptible, and one can imagine clever usage of the gyros creating all manner of subtle but convincing pushes and pulls. The concept was taken to a local extreme a few meters away at the University of Chicago’s booth, where attendees were fitted with a large powered backpack with a motorized weight that could move up and down quickly. This was used to provide the illusion of a higher or lower jump, as by shifting the weight at the proper moment one seems to be lightened or accelerated upwards, or alternately pushed downwards — if a mistake in the associated jumping game is made.  Our colleagues at Engadget wrote up the particulars of the tech ahead of its debut last week. While the bulky mechanism and narrow use case mark it like the others as a proof of concept, it shows that the perception of bodily motion, not just of an object or one appendage, can be affected by judicious use of force.  When it comes to the sensation of holding things, current VR controllers also fall short. While the motion-tracking capabilities of the latest Quest and PlayStation VR2 headsets are nothing short of amazing, one never feels one truly interacting with the objects in a virtual environment.  The Tokyo Institute of Technology team created an ingenious — and hilariously fiddly — method of simulating the feeling of touching or holding an object with your fingertips. The user is fitted with four tiny rings on each hand, one for each finger excepting the pinky. Each ring is fitted with a tiny little motor on top, and from each motor depends a tiny little loop of thread, which is fitted around the pad of each fingertip. The positions of the hands and fingers are tracked with a depth sensor attached (just barely) to the headset. In a VR simulation, a tabletop is covered in a variety of cubes and other shapes. When the tracker detects that your virtual hand intersects with the edge of a virtual block, the motor spins a bit and tugs on the loop — which feels quite a lot like something touching the pads of your fingers! Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch It all sounds very janky, and it definitely was — but the basic idea and sensation was worth experiencing and the setup was clearly not too expensive. Haptic gloves that can simulate resistance are few and far between, and quite complicated to boot (in fact another researcher present worked on this device, a more complex version of a similar principle). A refined version of this system might be made for under $100 and provide a basic experience that is still transformative. SIGGRAPH and this hall in particular were full of these and more experiences that rode the line between the physical and digital. While VR has yet to take off in the mainstream, many have taken that to mean that they should redouble efforts to improve and expand it, rather than give it up as a dead platform. The conference also showcased a great deal of overlap between gaming, VFX, art, virtual production, and numerous other domains. The brains behind these experiments and the more established products on the expo floor clearly feel that the industry is converging while diversifying, and a multi-modal, multi-medium, multi-sensory experience is the future. But it isn’t inevitable — someone has to make it. So they’re getting to work."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/ending-bitter-court-battle-wisk-and-archer-collaborate/,TechCrunch,"Electric aircraft makers Wisk and Archer end bitter legal dispute, agree to work together","Electric aircraft rivals Wisk and Archer Aviation have settled their trade secret legal dispute more than two years after the lawsuit was originally filed. In a somewhat surprise twist — given how bitterly the legal battle had become — the two companies have agreed to collaborate. Archer also agreed to make Wisk its exclusive provider of autonomy technology to be integrated into a future autonomous variant of Archer’s Midnight aircraft, in addition to the collaboration, according to a source familiar with the settlement. In a separate piece of news that broke Thursday, Archer said it had raised $215 million in new capital from its manufacturing partner Stellantis, Boeing, United Airlines, Ark Investment Management LLC and others, to accelerate its path to commercialization. Boeing’s portion of that new investment is going to support the collaboration between Wisk and Archer on autonomy, the source said. The exact amount of Boeing’s investment was not disclosed. Boeing has poured hundreds of millions into Wisk, including a $450 million investment in January 2022. Wisk became a fully-owned subsidiary of Boeing this year. Under the terms of the settlement, Archer also agreed to give Wisk the option to purchase up to 13,176,636 shares of common stock at a price of $0.01 per share. The new agreement settles all previous claims and suits, including Archer’s counter-suit against Wisk seeking $1 billion in damages. “We are pleased to have reached a mutually agreeable settlement with Archer that resolves our concerns while also eliminating the need for a costly and distracting trial,” a Wisk spokesperson said. “Wisk is committed to working collaboratively within the industry and leading in autonomous passenger flight.” Thus closes the bitter court battle between the two electric aircraft developers, a battle that’s dragged on for over two years, after Wisk accused Archer in April 2021 for “brazen theft” of confidential information and intellectual property. Those included over fifty trade secrets that Wisk alleged were stolen by a former employee who was later hired by Archer. Despite multiple mediation attempts, the two companies had been unable to come to an agreement. The lawsuit was scheduled to go to trial on September 12, so the settlement came right at the last minute. As the lawsuit raged on, Archer continued on its path to commercializing its first electric aircraft, called Midnight. Along with the earnings and new investment, the company announced Thursday that it had received a key certification from regulators greenlighting Midnight for flight test operations. The certificate – called a Special Airworthiness Certificate from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration – is a crucial step in certifying Midnight before it can start commercial service. Archer has also landed a handful of other big wins this year, signaling that it is one of the unequivocal leaders in electric aviation: In June, the company announced that former FAA administrator Billy Nolen joined as chief safety officer; and last month, the U.S. Air Force agreed to purchase up to six electric aircraft from Archer, in a deal worth up to $142 million."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/insiders-bet-more-on-fizz-a-social-network-that-has-now-bubbled-up-at-80-college-campuses/,TechCrunch,"Insiders bet more on Fizz, a social network that has now bubbled up at  80+ college campuses","Fizz, a burgeoning social network established by two Stanford dropouts, captured the attention and interest of Stanford University students early on with its approach to anonymity and engagement. Now the two-year-old platform is gaining traction well beyond the Stanford campus but, like any social media company, it faces its share of challenges, too. Fizz operates on a distinct model that invites individuals with a Stanford email address to join its network, allowing them to contribute and comment anonymously within the community. Other users can then upvote or downvote these posts, contributing to the “karma” score of the content and elevating certain users’ “fizzfluence,” even while their identities remain concealed. Sunny Xun Liu, Associate Director of Stanford’s Social Media Lab, highlights the platform’s appeal, pointing out that Fizz permits open discussions on a wide range of topics, from “sex to drinks to drugs to which classes to come to” on campus. She believes Fizz’s connection to physical campus activities enhances its allure, with its focus on anonymity allowing content to take precedence over authorship. Despite its local roots, Fizz is expanding its reach. CEO Rakesh Mathur says the network is accessible at more than 80 campuses across the nation and that it aims to expand to 250 schools by year’s end. That success has been accompanied by a substantial boost in funding, with earlier investors Owl Ventures and NEA newly injecting $25 million in Series B funding into the platform at a valuation that Mathur declines to share. (Owl chipped in $10 million, with NEA providing between $12 million and $15 million, according to one source.) At a time when revenue has become a focal point for VCs, the round is notable. Indeed, the business model is still a “work in progress,” acknowledges Danielle Lay, a partner at NEA and an observer on Fizz’s board. Still, she cites the success of specialized vertical networks in coexisting alongside broader social platforms, noting for example that on a broader-based social network, few would know that Arrillaga, as Stanford students use the name, is a reference to the university’s gym. (The 75,000-square-foot gym was named after billionaire real estate developer and philanthropist John Arrillaga, who attended Stanford on a basketball scholarship.) Lay also believes that Fizz’s appeal to incoming freshmen provides an added edge, with new students using the app to quickly wrap their heads around what’s going on at a school. As for whether college students alone can fuel a vast social network one day, Emily Bennett, a principal at Owl Ventures, says she’s not concerned with Fizz’s limited focus today. Fizz can always figure out how to serve members of Gen Z as they graduate, she suggests, explaining that her own stints at Meta, Spotify and the New York Times as a product manager taught her when scaling consumer apps, the focus needs to be “creating real utility with your user base first.” While Fizz’s rise has been promising, it’s not without hurdles. Fizz has been able to see quick pick-up at schools on the cheap — usually after paying “student ambassadors” to hand out fliers and crucially, suggests Mathur, donuts. But concerns about content moderation and privacy breaches have arisen. Volunteer moderators, primarily students, have the authority to take down posts they consider inappropriate or offensive, and accusations of bias have emerged. In 2021, Fizz also encountered a privacy breach at the hands of three Stanford students who said afterward that they were “initially concerned by Fizz’s strong public claims of total anonymity.” A year later, Solomon told TechCrunch: “Our security practices have significantly evolved and we remain committed to the security and privacy of our users as Fizz grows.” Comparisons have arisen between Fizz and YikYak, a once-prominent social network that also targeted college campuses. YikYak’s rapid ascent was overshadowed by concerns over hate speech and threats, eventually leading to its closure in 2017, four years after its launch. Mathur maintains that Fizz is distinct, boasting better onboarding and more stringent moderation, but the inherent complications of managing user-generated content persist. Amid its challenges, Fizz’s growth continues. The platform has now secured $41.5 million in total funding through various investment rounds, with its founders, Teddy Solomon and Ashton Cofer, recently hinting at more plans for the network’s future, including testing out an online marketplace feature that allows students to sell items to one another. Mathur further suggests that job listings could be on the horizon, and that a prominent (as yet unnamed) executive is joining Fizz as its chief product officer next month."

While VW seemed to tease such a model in a 2019 presentation, German publisher Edison reports that a camper van based on the ID.Buzz EV is not coming anytime soon. Maybe not even within this decade. The apparent reason? At more than three tons, current designs would simply be too heavy for European drivers with a standard category B license, Edison wrote. A U.S.-based VW spokesperson was unable to comment on the accuracy of the report. Cashing in on nostalgia for its classic Type 2 microbus, VW dangled the ID.Buzz for years and years before kicking off deliveries in Europe last year. Instead of launching the same vehicle in the U.S., VW determined that what Americans really desire is a version that’s about 10 inches longer, to make room for a third row of seats. The automaker said it will start selling this supersized ID.Buzz in the U.S. starting in the third quarter of 2024. In the meantime, VW said it’s testing a version of the van with self-driving hardware in Austin, Texas. I’m not sure that’s what Americans really want, but that’s what’s happening. As for VW’s next camper, Edison reports the firm will present a hybrid camper based on the VW Multivan (instead of the ID.Buzz) around the end of August or early September."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/7-vcs-explain-why-the-creator-economy-still-has-legs/,TechCrunch,7 VCs explain why the creator economy still has legs,"The White House is briefing TikTokers about the war in Ukraine. A Twitch streamer’s PS5 giveaway sparks a bonafide riot. A 25-year-old YouTuber from North Carolina is one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world. If you underestimate the power of internet personalities, you’re not paying attention. In Silicon Valley, “creator economy” used to be nearly as hot a buzzword as “AI” is right now. But even as content creators remain at the forefront of culture, the numbers behind venture capital investments tell a different story: Last year, the amount of money invested in creator economy companies dropped around 68% from the first to third quarter. But creator economy investors remain unfazed by what may seem like a steep decline. Several investors told TechCrunch+ that they knew that the entertainment industry would weather some twists and turns as the world exits pandemic-era lockdowns and that trends in venture can be cyclical. Some investors even said that the creator economy has yet to reach full maturity. To learn more about the state of the creator economy industry and how investors are thinking, we surveyed seven VCs about where the industry is headed, the rise of short-form video, the shifting role of influencer marketing, and what the launch of new platforms portends. We spoke with: Is the accelerated launch of new Twitter competitors a boon or an impediment to creator success?  Competition is good for creators since the platforms will have to compete for the creators’ time, which is a limited resource. To attract and keep creators, platforms will have to continue to offer monetization opportunities, which will spur potential bidding wars — as we saw with Kick and Twitch. The creator economy has seen a slowdown in venture funding over the last few years. Did you anticipate this, and how are you preparing your portfolio companies to navigate a crowded market with less available capital? The growth in the creator space was fueled in two parts: by COVID and the boom in e-commerce (the primary advertiser in the creator economy). People have largely returned to their ordinary lives and e-commerce has reverted to its usual pace, so the slower growth of the creator space is not surprising. Despite this, we still expect significant growth over the next few years, and believe the market has yet to reach maturity. The best companies still have access to capital, while slower-growing businesses are preserving the cash they have. Many VCs backed long-tail creator businesses or ones with a web3 focus, which have largely struggled to gain traction, so their attention has shifted to other areas such as AI. What do you see as differentiated business models in this space given the intense competition? Differentiated business models are ones that can either service the largest creators or service the long-tail with minimal human touch required. What kinds of creator economy companies are you most excited to invest in right now? We are excited about companies that are providing access to capital or some form of predictable monetization. We anticipate that predictable monetization and monetization infrastructure will continue to make the creator economy more investable for debt and equity investors alike. Will the economics of the digital economy be better for creators and creator-focused startups in the back half of 2023 than the first was? How will 2024 compare to 2023? A rising tide raises all ships, so what’s good for the creator is good for the creator-focused startup. With all of the changes in the last 12 months, many creators are just catching their breath. This year continues to be a challenging one for the ecosystem, as brands have pulled back ad budgets, capital markets have frozen and many fear a slowing economy. Looking toward 2024, we will hopefully see a reversal in those three trends and allow for a more confident creator economy. Social platforms have yet to figure out how to share ad revenue from short-form video. Where do you see platform-creator economics shaking out in the next few quarters? YouTube’s 55% / 45% model is a good paradigm for the platforms to mirror, but ultimately, the economic split will depend on competition and scale. The introduction of Kick has forced Twitch’s hand to improve its payouts, so the competitiveness of platforms will hopefully be a benefit to the creators as they continue to seek the best monetization opportunities. How can companies protect their creators in the event that they might shut down? It depends on the company and whether or not they are genuinely creator-first. But companies interested in protecting creators are likely to merge or sell rather than completely go under, as this would create a better outcome for their investors and customers. How is an uneven economy affecting consumer spend on creator products? Creator products is a nascent category, and there is likely some pent-up demand to purchase their products, at least in the short-term. Creators who offer lower average order value (AOV) products will likely see maintained demand, while higher AOV items may see a slowdown. Consumers are almost through their excess savings from COVID, so the next six months will be telling for the state of consumer demand. Do you think influencer marketing is becoming more or less powerful? How does this stack up against traditional avenues of marketing? Micro influencers have the highest ROI [return on investment] for advertisers but, obviously, the least amount of scale. So CMOs and ad buyers will be significantly more ROI-focused as they approach creators and influencer campaigns. What trends in the creator economy do you think are being overlooked? Access to capital and predictable monetization. These are the underpinnings of a stable and mature industry. Many social platforms have developed creator programs over the last several years. What are the different metrics you look at to gauge the success of a creator program? Which one is leading the pack? Predictability and consistency of monetization are the most important. TikTok is an interesting case study, because it launched a monetization platform for its creators, but the viewership and the revenue per thousand impressions (RPM) vary widely from video to video, meaning that a creator can predict how much money they will make each month even if they produce 10 videos a month. Is the accelerated launch of new Twitter competitors a boon or an impediment to creator success? Despite its pervasiveness among VCs and other professional wordsmiths, Twitter is pretty much irrelevant to most creators. Word-based platforms are difficult to monetize (for both creators and platforms . . . just ask Twitter creditors), so Twitter and the like work best as a tool to amplify messages rather than make money or truly engage audiences.

2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/instagrams-code-reveals-a-meta-verified-feed-filter-but-company-denies-active-test/,TechCrunch,"Instagram’s code reveals a ‘Meta Verified’ feed filter, but company denies active test","It looks like Instagram may have considered copying another Twitter feature by elevating Verified users to a more prominent spot in the Instagram app, according to a new discovery in the app’s code. According to reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, both the iOS and Android Instagram apps are now showing a new feed filter that would display “Meta Verified” subscribers alongside the chronological Following and Favorites feeds Instagram introduced last year. Instagram, however, dismissed the new finding saying, “This is not a feature we’re testing,” in a comment to TechCrunch. The company declined to say if the feature was in internal development or if it was a feature it considered, then decided not to pursue. But Paluzzi tells TechCrunch the feature was added to the code in the Android app (v296.0.0.0.16) released on August 4th and in the iOS app (v295.0) released just yesterday. That seems to imply something that’s newly in development — which wouldn’t make Meta’s statement on the matter incorrect, just a bit misleading. Whether or not Meta moves forward with the concept of a filter just for Verified creators remains to be seen, but it wouldn’t be the worst idea, we’d argue. Likely, such a feed would primarily consist of creator content, as those users benefit the most from the verification process which provides perks like proactive impersonation protection, direct access to customer support, exclusive stickers, 100 Stars per month to support other creators, and, of course, the coveted blue checkmark — which also translates over to Instagram’s new app, Threads. By adding “Meta Verified” to the feed filtering options on Instagram, the company would be offering creators an opportunity for increased visibility.  Users who engage with Instagram’s feed filters on a regular basis may click over to the new option to browse content from favorite creators instead of just viewing their friends’ posts. Launched after Twitter Blue, the feature set for Meta Verified was clearly inspired by Twitter’s efforts to monetize its most active creators. Twitter Blue, or X Premium as it’s now called as part of the larger X rebranding, provides a variety of features to elevate subscribers’ posts, including by giving them their own Verified tab in users’ Notifications, in addition to other features like limited ads, an edit button, support for longer posts and more. Paluzzi discovered the new filter and posted on X what the Meta Verified drop-down looks like. For now, it appears as the third option in the list of feed filters and is designated by a checkmark."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/skydio-closing-consumer-drone-business/,TechCrunch,Skydio closing consumer drone business,"Skydio today announced that it will be shutting down its consumer drone business. Beginning today, the firm will no longer be selling its Skydio 2+ Starter, Sports, Cinema or Pro kits, although it will continue to offer the Skydio 2+ Enterprise Kit to business customers. Skydio also promises to continue supporting those consumers who have already purchased a drone. That includes offering vehicle repairs and other support related to warranties. The company says it will also stock batteries, propellers and other accessories “for as long as we can.” Skydio is closing up its consumer wing as it expands support for various enterprise offerings. The firm has established 1,500 clients that also include various public service applications. Our drones are making the core industries that our civilization runs on – public safety, transportation, energy, construction, and defense – safer and more efficient,” founder Adam Bry writes in a post outlining the news. “And it’s becoming more and more clear every day that we need trusted, secure drones to meet these critical applications. The impact we’re having with our enterprise and public sector customers has become so compelling that it demands nothing less than our full focus and attention.” The Bay Area-based Skydio has seen a massive boost, as drone giant DJI has landed on the wrong side of various government bans amid rising U.S./China tensions. It’s been a large driver in domestic security adoptions of its system. Government contracts are – understandably – an extremely enticing model than consumer sales. And besides, DJI continues to dominate that world. Earlier this year, the company raised a $230 million Series E fundraising round."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/lyft-takes-a-page-from-ubers-playbook-ads/,TechCrunch,Lyft takes a page from Uber’s playbook: Ads,"Ride-hailing giant Lyft will start displaying ads in-app, as well as via in-car tablets, rooftops and bikeshare stations. “Lyft has a captive audience throughout their entire ride journey – waiting for their car, matching with their driver, and in ride – and brands can now reach riders in relevant and tailored ways across our suite of Lyft Media products,” said Zach Greenberger, Lyft’s chief business officer, in a statement. I know what you’re thinking. Thank goodness, more ads! Even better, ads via the app that know exactly where you are and where you’re going! Getting dropped off at a friend’s place who happens to live near a movie theater? Don’t be surprised if you see an ad for whatever is playing at that cinema when you check your ETA. Lyft getting into ads shouldn’t surprise anybody. Uber launched its own ads unit in October 2022, and the company forecasts ad revenue will hit $650 million this year. Compared to the $8 billion in revenue Uber pulled via mobility, delivery and freight in Q2, $650 million is chump change. But the room for growth is there, and Lyft undoubtedly sees a chance to bring in more revenue in an asset-light way. Lyft’s stock has slipped 6% since the company reported its second-quarter earnings. The company met Wall Street analysts’ revenue expectations, projected steady growth for the year and increased its ridership numbers. Yet, revenue per active rider decreased, as the company chopped its fares in an attempt to keep its prices competitive with Uber’s. Over the past year, Lyft has done some belt-tightening in order to focus on its core ride-hailing business. That includes shutting down its in-house car rental service and exploring a possible sale of its shared micromobility unit. Those units are both decidedly not asset-light models. Advertising could present a low capex way to add a revenue stream. Lyft said its in-app ads will show up on riders’ ETA screens, when they match with a driver and during their trip. Ads will also play on in-car tablets, which drivers can request to “boost their earnings with advertising revenue and higher tips,” according to Lyft. The company didn’t respond in time to TechCrunch to explain what percentage of ad revenue will go to drivers, if drivers need to pay for the tablets, how much those tablets might cost, or how having a tablet in the backseat can boost tips. Lyft said that drivers who give at least 60 rides per week and have an an-enabled tablet in their car can increase their tips by more than 10% on average. The company’s current ad partners include Bilt Rewards, Audible and Universal Pictures. Lyft said it’s partnering with Kantar Brand Lift Insights to help brands understand metrics like awareness, purchase intent and brand association. The company will also incorporate Rokt’s ad serving technology and programmatic solutions. At launch, brands can advertise nationally in the app, across in-car tablets in 12 markets, on car digital screens in five markets and across bikeshare in four markets, according to Lyft."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/data-visualization-startup-virtualitics-lands-37m-investment/,TechCrunch,Data visualization startup Virtualitics lands $37M investment,"Many companies grapple with data challenges. In a 2019 survey, Deloitte reports that 67% of executives aren’t comfortable accessing or using the data at their organizations. In a separate poll from NewVantage Partners, meanwhile, less than a third of firms identify themselves as being data-driven — despite significant investments in AI and business analytics tools. According to Michael Amori, the problem often lies in tooling. He’s the co-founder of Virtualitics, a startup developing software to help companies visualize — and gain insights, with any luck — from their data. “Common dashboard tools fall short of revealing the hidden insights buried in today’s intricate data,” Amori told me in an email interview. “And when bias, privacy and ethics are becoming even more important, having a solid understanding of the data, outliers and patterns, companies can create an environment of responsible usage.” Virtualitics, launched in 2016, was born out of Caltech and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena. A few years ago, Amori was introduced to George Djorgovski, a professor of astronomy and data science at Caltech, and Ciro Donalek, a computational staff scientist at Caltech’s Center for Data-Driven Discovery, which Djorgovski was heading at the time. “Donalek’s expertise in AI, particularly in aiding Caltech astronomers with big data analysis, and his work in creating collaborative virtual spaces converged,” Amori said. “Virtualitics was born from this, focusing on three-dimensional visualizations to elevate data analysis beyond traditional methods.” At a high level, Virtualitics uses 3D visualizations, knowledge graphs and AI to expose the relationships between different points of data. Given a data set (or several), optionally along with a question in plain English (e.g. “What drives credit card skimming?”), the platform can generate annotations and explanations, which can then be embedded in reports and dashboards and shared with stakeholders across an organization. A customer in the financial industry could, for example, use Virtualitics to spot patterns of payment and wire fraud. Or a marketing company could leverage the platform to identify emerging customer segments and the marketing channels most likely to perform best. But plenty of business intelligence tools visualize data, including Bayes, which Airtable acquired in 2021, and London-based, Canva-owned Flourish. So what makes Virtualitics different? Its data visualizations can be viewed in VR and AR, for one. But Amori argues the platform’s also simpler to use and more powerful than most solutions on the market — and, perhaps most important of all, doesn’t require deep technical expertise. Virtualitics’ 3D-centric data visualization platform. “Traditional data exploration tools have limited capabilities in identifying and visualizing the complexity of today’s data,” he said. “Also, traditional analytic techniques and dashboards fall short in providing visually intuitive outputs, making it hard to truly understand what the findings mean or predict what lies ahead. All of this is combined with the fact that humans approach a data set already with a bias, a preconceived notion of what might be going on in the data and then they explore the data to see if their hypothesis was correct.” The jury’s out on all that. But it’s certainly true that companies often struggle to drive internal use of whatever business intelligence software they’ve invested in. In a 2020 business intelligence survey from 360Suite, companies said that the main challenges they face are managing user adoption and data quality control. Cost control and security were cited as the other major blockers in achieving data analytics goals. “While Virtualitics may occasionally find itself categorized alongside business intelligence tools, our approach is substantially different,” Amori said. “Traditional business intelligence tools are built to ‘report the news,’ with the aim of making data more accessible through simple dashboard reports.” In a testament to Virtualitics’ success — or at least the strength of its marketing efforts — the company’s year-over-year revenue has increased 370%. Amori credits Virtualitics’ recently acquired government sector customers, which include the Department of Defense, with the growth. “Virtualitics has partnered with the defense and national security community since 2017 on projects ranging from operational readiness, investment analysis and mission support and intelligence analysis, among others,” Amori said, noting that Virtualitics recently appointed a retired U.S. Army General, John Murray, and former U.S. Navy Vice Admiral, Timothy White, to its advisory board. Gearing up for the next phase of expansion, Virtualitics today announced that it raised $37 million in a Series C funding round led by Smith Point Capital with participation from Citi and advisory clients of The Hillman Company. Bringing the startup’s total raised to $67 million, Amori says that the new cash will be put toward collaborations, customer success efforts and expanding Virtualitics’ headcount (which currently stands at 76 people). “The motivation behind raising a Series C funding round was driven by two key factors,” Amori said. “First, our company has a strong track record of successfully collaborating with the Department of Defense on mission-critical programs, and this aspect of our business continues to experience significant growth and expansion. However, we also recognize the increasing demand for AI-driven analysis within the enterprise sector, as data size and complexity continue to grow exponentially. With the new funding, we will be able to accelerate our roadmap, integrating more AI and specifically generative AI technology into our platform, and further scaling our business to meet the evolving needs of our customers and the market.”"
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/sec-appeal-federal-court-ruling-xrp-case-2023/,TechCrunch,"SEC bites back, to appeal federal court ruling in XRP case","In mid-July, a federal court settled a years-long battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC to decide if Ripple’s XRP token was a security or not. Southern District of New York judge Analisa Torres ruled that the XRP token is not a security when sold to the general public, but it could be treated as one with regard to past sales to institutional clients. The regulator doesn’t seem to be happy with that partial victory: The SEC said in a court filing on Wednesday that it would file an “interlocutory appeal” for Torres’ ruling. “Interlocutory review is warranted here,” the SEC said in its new filing. “These two issues involve controlling questions of law on which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion, as reflected by an intra-district split that has already developed.” Basically, this means the SEC wants a redo on the first half of the case, and to be fair, the somewhat “split” ruling was a bit confusing initially: Torres had said that some of Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP tokens didn’t violate securities laws because they involved a bidding process, but direct sales to institutions did fall under the ambit of securities laws. The SEC’s move this week doesn’t come as a surprise. The regulator had complained after the ruling that the verdict was “wrongly decided” and the court “should not follow them,” and even repeated its statement in legal documents for a separate case against Terraform Labs. But Ripple won’t shy away from the SEC’s likely appeal, Stu Alderoty, chief legal officer of Ripple Labs, told me on Chain Reaction in late July. “We think the judge got that right, and we think that was a faithful application of the law. A court of appeals will not only affirm that, but maybe even amplify that to even a greater extent.” The SEC’s new filing needs to be approved by the US SDNY for appeal, and then by the court of appeals. Once it jumps those hurdles, the SEC would need permission from the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The SEC and Ripple have been at it in the courts since 2020, when the agency alleged that the crypto firm raised $1.3 billion via sales of XRP, which it claimed was an unregistered security."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/marc-raibert-and-gill-pratt-will-discuss-state-of-the-art-research-at-techcrunch-disrupt/,TechCrunch,Marc Raibert and Gill Pratt will discuss state-of-the-art research at TechCrunch Disrupt,"Marc Raibert founded the Leg Laboratory at CMU back in 1980. After moving homes to MIT in 1986, it became one of the most important research facilities in robotics. It’s been foundational in the development of robotic motion and has served as a launching pad for some of the industry’s brightest minds. Central to that list is Gill Pratt, the MIT assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science who served as lab director until 2001. We’re excited to announce that Raibert and Pratt will reunite at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 at San Francisco’s Moscone Center on September 21. These two technology luminaries will be coheadlining a fireside panel on Disrupt’s Hardware Stage to highlight some of the latest innovations their respective teams have been working on in the fields of robotics, AI and mobility. Their paths diverged somewhat after their respective stints at the Leg Lab. Raibert used much of the team’s learnings as the foundation of Boston Dynamics, serving as the company’s CEO for nearly three decades and overseeing the creation of some the world’s most advanced and instantly recognizable robots. After his time at MIT, Pratt continued to teach, serving as professor at Olin’s College of Engineering for much of the following decade. After a stint serving as program manager at DARPA’s Defense Sciences Offices, he was named Chief Scientist, Toyota Motor Corporation and CEO, Toyota Research Institute. Toyota Research Institute has become a leading research organization, focused on robotics, smart cities and automotives. It’s here that their paths converge again. Raibert left his CEO role in 2020, as Boston Dynamics has ramped up its product commercialization. Almost exactly one year ago, the company’s new owner, Hyundai, announced the launch of the Boston Dynamics AI institute. While it carries the same name and some of the same talent, the institute is an independent organization, which – much like TRI – is devoted to pure research. Raibert and Pratt will be joining us to showcase their respective organizations’ latest work and discuss what the world of research looks like beyond university walls.

2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/oracle-suse-and-ciq-launch-the-open-enterprise-linux-association-amid-red-hat-controversy/,TechCrunch,"Oracle, SUSE and CIQ launch the Open Enterprise Linux Association amid Red Hat controversy","The fallout from Red Hat’s recent decision to make it harder to access the source code of its flagship Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) distribution continues. A number of Linux distributions, including Alma Linux, Rocky Linux and Oracle Linux, based their distributions on RHEL. When Red Hat cut off the standard ways they used to get the source code for their distributions, SUSE quickly jumped into the breach with a RHEL fork. Today, Oracle, SUSE and CIQ (the commercial entity behind Rocky Linux) are launching a more formal pact in the form of the Open Enterprise Linux Association (OpenELA), which describes itself as a “community repository for enterprise Linux sources.” In the context of the Red Hat saga, OpenELA’s tagline says a lot: “No subscriptions. No passwords. No barriers. Freeloaders welcome.” Image Credits: SUSE The association’s stated mission is to encourage the development of RHEL-compatible distributions by providing open and free Enterprise Linux source code, starting later this year with the sources necessary to build RHEL 8 and 9. Support for RHEL 7 is currently being listed as “possibly.” “Collaboration is critical to fostering innovation, which is why we welcome everyone to be part of this association and help us uphold open community standards,” said Thomas Di Giacomo, chief technology and product officer of SUSE. “SUSE is a strong believer in making choice happen. Together with the open source community we will redefine what it truly means to be open and deliver a stronger future for EL.” Red Hat’s decision left a vacuum in the Linux distribution space and SUSE, as one of the largest commercial Linux entities besides Red Hat, seems to be more than willing to fill it. Oracle’s association with this project may be a bit more of a surprise — and its reputation in the open-source ecosystem remains tarnished — but the company has long based its Oracle Linux distribution on Red Hat, and the Oracle Cloud essentially runs on it. Unlike some other companies, though, Oracle Linux offers support for what it calls the ‘Red Hat Compatible Kernel’ and the ‘Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel’ with its own enhancements. It’s also worth noting that SUSE’s existing portfolio of Linux distributions won’t change because of this move. “We will, of course, stay fully committed to our own Linux portfolio as well as to our openSUSE Linux distributions,” wrote Vojtěch Pavlík, SUSE’s GM for business-critical Linux, in a separate blog post today. “With our introduction of Liberty Linux last year, which provides support to former CentOS users and provides a migration path to many other distributions, we set the stage by supporting customers regardless of the distribution they are using, leading to more diversity and openness in the communities.” The founding companies note that they invite other organizations and community members to join the new Linux foundation association."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/shared-micromobility-firm-veo-launches-retail-seated-scooter/,TechCrunch,Shared micromobility firm Veo launches retail seated scooter,"Veo, one of the shared micromobility firms that secured New York City’s e-scooter permit, is moving into retail. Starting Thursday, the company will be selling its Cosmo X seated, pedal-less scooter across the United States. Veo will start with a small pilot and limit its first batch to 1,000 scooters in 2023. While e-bikes are selling fast in the U.S., the business case for them can be finicky. Shared micromobility competitor Bird tried, and failed, to sell its own e-bike in the past, and VanMoof just filed for bankruptcy despite the popularity of its bikes. That’s why Veo wants to take it slowly, gauge customer interest and move forward from there. “The reason why we felt the timing was right and the vehicle was right was because we already have millions of users on our platform and have a very stable, reliable and popular vehicle type that has served tens of millions of trips already,” Candice Xie, Veo co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “The vehicle we’re launching direct-to-consumer is actually one of our most popular vehicle types in all markets.” Veo’s shared micromobility service is available in more than 50 markets across the United States, and includes e-bikes, pedal bikes and electric kick scooters. Xie said customers had already been inquiring about purchasing the Cosmo X, giving her and other company execs the confidence to move forward with this new business unit. And since it’s effectively the same scooter that is on streets today for shared use, Xie thinks Veo will be able to avoid the problems that Bird had with its own retail bike. “Bird kind of created a low-end copycat version of VanMoof’s product,” said Xie. “But people realized there were qualitative differences.” VanMoof’s mistakes were in part due to quality issues. VanMoof refused to use off-the-shelf parts, so when parts started breaking down, it was difficult for customers to get repairs and servicing done in a timely manner. That was only exacerbated by VanMoof’s subpar after-sales service and on-the-ground logistics network. Veo already has service and distribution centers across the country, and plans to expand that network, so its scooters will be able to avoid the logistics and supply chain issues that VanMoof faced, said Xie. The founder is hopeful that Veo’s scooters, which have already proven they can withstand getting beat up on the streets, won’t need nearly as much servicing as VanMoof bikes did. “We want to run this as a long-term business, and we have patience,” said Xie, noting that Veo might offer other form factors in the future. To test the business case, Veo will offer a limited quantity of about 1,000 scooters this year. The company wants to take its time to understand which areas internally it would need to invest more into to make a D2C business successful, and which markets have room for growth before putting down heavy capital expenditures. If this year goes well, Veo will be able to sell tens of thousands of scooters next year. Veo’s Cosmo X seated scooter has a waterproof swappable battery. Image Credits: Veo Veo’s Cosmo X starts at $3,499, putting it firmly on the premium end of the e-scooter spectrum. Xie said the lead time is three months for the X, but if customers want a cheaper version in a faster time frame, they can purchase the Cosmo S vendor version, which will cost $2,899 and start shipping in September. For buyers who purchase during the pre-order period, a free detachable basket and helmet is included. The main difference between the Cosmo X and shared Cosmo S is the ability to customize the former to the owner’s tastes. Users will be able to choose between fun colors for the body like Malibu pink, cosmic blue or Moondust, as well as a range of rim colors. The scooter will also greet its owner by name when it’s turned on, and to be clear, you can choose any name. “Hello Obi-Wan. Are you ready for liftoff?”  Here are some of the Cosmo X’s specs: Finally, at launch, riders will be able to access their personal scooters through a different portal on the same Veo app that exists for shared rides."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/tracer-nabs-18-1-to-aggregate-and-normalize-business-data/,TechCrunch,Tracer nabs $18.1m to aggregate and normalize business data,"Tracer, a platform that attempts to consolidate an organization’s data sources and enrich them with business insights, today announced that it raised $18.1 million in a Series A funding round co-led by NewRoad Capital Partners, Progress Ventures, and BDMI with participation from S4S Ventures and Arbour Way Investors. CEO Jeff Nicholson said that the new cash will be put toward Tracer’s expansion efforts, scaling its technology, establishing a sales team and “enhancing” the startup’s client success resources. To date, Tracer has raised $30 million. “With the backing of our investors and confidence in our future, Tracer is well-positioned to achieve continued success and make a significant impact in the market, not only for marketers but also to empower businesses spanning diverse industries,” Nicholson told TechCrunch via email. Tracer traces its roots back to 2015 when co-founders Nicholson and Leighton Welch pitched Gary Vaynerchuk, the entrepreneur and internet personality, on building out a global media department inside of Vaynerchuk’s creative agency, VaynerMedia. Over the next few years, the media department grew from a few people to a few hundred people, all the while incubating a tech company to power the department as it scaled. The tech company became Tracer, which spun out as an LLC in 2018 at the request of a customer. Nicholson came on as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Tracer raised its first seed round. “Most companies today are doing reporting and analytics by building out a ‘modern data stack,'” Nicholson said. “We believe that’s too expensive — and too complicated. The modern data stack is a means to an end — reporting and analytics – and the intellectual property is in how you use it.” Image Credits: Tracer So what does Tracer do, exactly? A few things. First, the platform ingests data ranging from advertising and sales metrics to customer data and web traffic. Then, it overlays business context on top of this data, outputting the results to spreadsheets, emails, databases, dashboards and other channels. A customer could use Tracer to, for example, visualize their media spend across all major platforms, or view analytics partner data and offline conversion data in a single pane of glass. “For the data or technical decision-maker or C-suite IT manager, enabling Tracer means cost, time and resources savings,” Nicholson said. “The technology is data agnostic, and we’re able to receive inputs from any source and deliver outputs to any platform … The alternative to Tracer is paying for a lot of different point solutions, and a lot of expensive resources to build and maintain something that is already available for them to use at a fraction of the cost.” There’s other software that performs the sort of aggregation that Tracer does, including tools sold by Salesforce, ThoughtSpot-backed Mode Analytics and Google-owned Looker. But Tracer has managed to grow slowly but steadily even in the face of competition, recently eclipsing 200 customers — a combination of direct and indirect business via its advertising agency partners — including Sanofi, Papa Johns, Headspace and Condé Nast. “While Tracer is a software-as-a-service product, we don’t charge by seat or license, meaning our clients have unlimited opportunities to put Tracer in the hands of any and all internal users that may want access — whether a brand, agency or global holding company,” Nicholson said. “Our growth in recent years is a testament to the value we bring to our clients, as well as the value our investors know we will continue to bring to the market as we continue to scale.”"
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/youtube-is-disabling-links-on-shorts-to-cut-down-on-spam/,TechCrunch,YouTube is disabling links on Shorts to cut down on spam,"YouTube Shorts is making a change to address the growing issues around spam on the short-form video platform. The company says that starting on August 31st, links that appear in the Shorts comments section, Shorts descriptions, and the vertical live feed will no longer be clickable. This new policy is meant to be a preventative measure that makes it harder for scammers and spammers to mislead and scam users via links. The company notes the change was necessary because the spammy links could drive users to dangerous content, like malware, phishing, or other scams. The measure is fairly extreme, given YouTube already has existing systems and policies designed to detect and remove spammy links. However, instead of relying on this technology, it’s disabling these links altogether. The changes will roll out gradually, which means not all links will be disabled as of August 31st. In addition, the company is removing the clickable social media icons from all desktop channel banners, as those have also been used to scam users with misleading links. However, legitimate creators have a use for links at times, particularly when it comes to monetizing their content by recommending products and brands to their followers. To address this, YouTube says it will introduce new ways for those users to safely include links in their content. Image Credits: YouTube Starting on August 23, YouTube viewers on mobile and desktop will begin to see “prominent” clickable links on creators’ channel profiles near their ‘Subscribe’ button. Creators can use this space to link out to websites, their other social profiles, merchandise sites, and other links that adhere to YouTube’s Community Guidelines.  In addition, Shorts creators who like to use links to point viewers to their long-form videos will still be able to do so in the near future. By the end of September, YouTube says it will introduce a new and safer way for those creators to drive viewers from Shorts to their other YouTube content, as well. These changes follow other measures YouTube has enacted to cut down on spam across the platform, including improvements to systems that detect impersonation channels. From Q1 2022 to Q1 2023, YouTube says it’s increased the number of impersonation-related removals and terminations by over 35%. It’s also improved its feature that detects and holds potentially spammy and inappropriate comments for optional review by creators, resulting in a 200% increase in comments held for review when comparing the first week of June after the changes went live, with the first week of May."
2023-08-10,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/startups-profitability-2023/,TechCrunch,"The most valuable startups are getting closer to profitability, but at a cost","Kingsley Amis was right to note that the metaphysical hangover that comes after too much drink is often worse than the physical shock of waking up and realizing that your head has been filled with angry wasps and your bones and organs are on strike. You can fix physical ailments with water, time, food and a tuft of fur from your household pet. But it often takes longer, and more work, to rectify one’s spirit after a real session at the bottle. Thus, today’s venture capital market. I won’t argue that the slowdown in venture capital spending has been easy on startups (accustomed to easy capital access through 2021) or their backers (accustomed to easy and frequent paper mark-ups on their investments through 2021), but at some point we have to acknowledge that the worst is behind us, and any remaining malaise is potentially psychosomatic. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. This column made an argument along those lines just a few weeks back, in fact. New data from Bessemer and Forbes underscores just how far startups have progressed since the venture market and tech economy hit turbulence in late 2021. As you’ll recall, startups were forced to change their posture after interest rates began to rise. All of a sudden, tech companies accustomed to double- or triple-digit multiples on their revenues were looking at a future where their price-sales multiples would land in the single digits. Suddenly, profitability and general business sustainability became hot topics, inspiring a thousand venture tweets and blog posts. The best startups listened. Anu Hariharan, a former Y Combinator and a16z investor, wrote earlier this week that many later-stage startups run by “great” founders “are on track to hit positive free cash flows and net income [positivity] without having to raise a single penny from external investors.” He added that quite a few of the unicorns in question have already achieved the feat. Hariharan wasn’t merely talking about her book — she’s on the boards of several startups valued at $1 billion or more. She was accurately describing the new reality of the best cut of late-stage startups. Each year, Bessemer and Forbes compile a list that they dub the Cloud 100. As all software is hosted on the cloud these days, it’s a list of tech startups that write and sell managed code, mostly. And the latest iteration that dropped this week had some fascinating data points. Bessemer’s cloud index is related, but different as it deals with public tech companies. Consolidating the data that I consider the most salient, observe the following: The average company listed in the 2023 Cloud 100 is worth $6.6 billion. That figure is off 10% from 2022 ($7.4 billion), but 27% above the 2021 average of $5.2 billion. For perspective, the 2020 figure was $2.7 billion, and an even smaller $1.7 billion in 2019. "

Dear Sophie, I was born in India and have been living and working in the U.S. on an H-1B with my current employer for four years. I tried to apply for one of the 10,000 H-1B visa holder work permits that Canada made available in July, but I didn’t get one.  I’ve decided to move forward and found my own startup in the U.S. What’s the best way for me to be able to stay in the U.S. and legally work for my startup?  — Fledgling Founder Hiya Fledgling! Kudos to you for your grit and determination to continue to build and innovate in the United States. You’ve got this — and I’ve got your back! Canada’s H-1B initiative and its overall work visa and permanent residence processes are far more appealing and effective in attracting and retaining international talent than the restrictive, complicated and backlogged immigration system individuals face in the United States. The U.S. must enact immigration legislation that helps startup founders and merit-based workers have a clear path. This has become a national security issue: Do we want the emerging technologies of the future to be created in the U.S.? Even state-level actors see the urgency and importance of founder immigration: California governor Gavin Newsom recently budgeted $2 million for a Global Entrepreneur in Residence (GEIR) pilot program in the University of California system. The program aims to attract and retain international talent by enabling the UC system to sponsor visas for individuals to build startups. Creating a strong foundation for your startup under corporate law and creating a strong startup to sponsor you for a work visa or green card under immigration law focus on different things. Because of that, I recommend you work with both an immigration lawyer and a corporate lawyer for guidance. During a chat with Michael Avent, a partner at multinational law firm Perkins Coie who works with emerging growth startups and VCs, he emphasized it’s crucial for prospective founders to keep in mind the proprietary inventions and assignment agreement that they likely signed with their current employer. Avent said one of the first things he does when meeting with prospective founders if they are currently working for a company is to go through the proprietary inventions and assignment agreement. “One of the things that we always think about at the earliest stage — even pre-company — is protecting the IP that’s going to form the foundation of the business and that can be complicated if you’re working someplace else.” Things get complicated with immigration law, too, since you cannot do any work for your startup without a work visa or other work authorization. Your H-1B usually authorizes you to work only for the company that sponsored your visa — your current employer. Working to get your startup off the ground without the proper work authorization could have a detrimental impact on your ability to remain in the U.S. and any future visas or green cards you apply for. However, there are things you can do that are not typically considered work, such as attending business meetings with prospective hires or investors or signing contracts. Ask your immigration lawyer about other activities you want to engage in to set up your startup to find out if they are allowed. Avent also highlighted a few things that will have a huge impact on your future as a founder and on that of the company that you should stay on top of as a founder. For example, he talked about the importance of meeting the filing deadline for Section 83(b), which enables a founder to be taxed on the equity in their startup on the date it was granted rather than when it vests. It can be “catastrophic to founders and their company if the 83(b) filing is missed,” he says, meaning potentially “hundreds of thousands [in] tax liability for the founder and withholding for the company.” In addition, Avent emphasized that founders pay close attention to the dilutive impact of a convertible security or SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) or multiple SAFEs. “You can inadvertently give away more of your company than you want if you don’t understand the mechanics.” "
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/saeki/,TechCrunch,SAEKI’s ‘microfactories’ help large manufacturing scale up,"The architecture, engineering and construction industries involve giant concrete molds that are expensive, slow to manufacture and often only used a few times before being disposed. Robots-as-a-service startup SAEKI says its tech makes creating these molds not only faster, but also more cost-efficient. The Lupfig, Switzerland–based company is building what it says will be fully automated plants with industrial robots that use 3D tech to create components like aircraft wings and construction site installations. SAEKI launched from stealth today with $2.3 million in seed funding led by Wingman Ventures, along with participation from Vento Ventures, Getty Capital and angel investors. It is currently building its first production hub, which will have industrial robots that are capable of combining digital manufacturing methods, including 3D printing, milling and inspection. SAEKI says the robots each act as “microfactories,” which means they are self-contained units that can do all manufacturing steps. SAEKI was founded in 2021 by Andrea Perissinotto, Oliver Harley and Matthias Leschok. Perissinotto told TechCrunch he became interested in manufacturing when he was a child, learning metalworking at his uncle’s workshop and building his first 3D printer when he was 12. He met Harley while building a large 3D printer for the maker space at ETH Zurich, where they were both studying, and they began working with Leschok to combine 3D printing and industrial robots. The three were completing their studies during the pandemic when Perissinotto decided he wanted to leave academia and become an entrepreneur. SAEKI was founded in February 2021 to combine robotics with 3D printing, machining and inspection. During that process, Perissinotto said he and his co-workers learned that 3D printing for large items, like wind turbine blades, airplane and car parts, was still early in development and not at industry quality and scale yet. They decided to focus their new startup on the issue by creating fully automated factories with independent robotic cells that customers can book. Want the top robotics news in your inbox each week? Sign up for Actuator here. SAEKI produces the large components needed by industries like construction, aerospace and automotive, without needing to retool their machines. This is a time- and cost-saving advantage for components that are used only a few times during the building and manufacturing process. For example, when constructing buildings out of concrete, builders first need a mold called a “formwork.” Unless it is being used for something standard, like a flat wall or ceiling, special formwork needs to be created from scratch. Typically, they are built by hand out of wood and scrapped after building is completed. SAEKI’s solution is to use recyclable thermoplastics that are 3D printed and processed by one of its robots and delivered to construction sites. It also plans to work with the composites industry, which builds the lightweight but strong parts found on airplanes, cars and bikes, among other things. These parts are usually made in complex molds created from metal or composite materials. Perissinotto said this creates a bottleneck for companies because the molds are expensive and need a long time to build. SAEKI’s goal is to reduce lead time costs and use their tooling processes to enable companies in the composites industry to have faster hardware production cycles. Since SAEKI’s robots act as “microfactories,” this means its customers do not have to purchase another new machine or take up more floor space in their facilities. Perissinotto said this is why SAEKI decided to use a robots-as-a-service business model, since that allows customers to just purchase the amount of time they need with a machine. SAEKI is currently finalizing its first pilot projects in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) sector, with customers using its 3D printed formwork to create custom concrete elements. Its target AEC clients include construction companies, pre-casters, interior designers and architects. Perissinotto said SAEKI is already generating revenue because of its pilot projects. It is building its first factory in Switzerland, but its robots are already operational and have already been producing parts for the last few months. In terms of competition, Perissinotto said additive manufacturing has been a “prominent topic” for years now, and even though there has been significant advancement in tech, market acceptance has not fully matched that progress, due in large part to the cost of the machinery involved. Even though additive manufacturing has gained some traction in the industrial market, it is still in the early stages when it comes to large-scale applications, he added. Companies that offer machines for large-scale additive manufacturing include CEAD B.V., Caracol AM and Therwood Inc, but Perissinotto said SAEKI’s customers want a different approach. “What we consistently hear from people and companies is a desire for faster more sustainable solutions for their parts,” he said. “Merely offering savings through a multi-million dollar machine that requires extensive space and additional resources, including hiring personnel well-versed in new processes and materials, is not appealing to them.”"
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/meta-adds-ability-to-verify-your-threads-profile-on-mastodon/,TechCrunch,Meta adds ability to verify your Threads profile on Mastodon,"Meta on Wednesday took a small step toward supporting the fediverse by adding the ability to verify your Threads profile on Mastodon. The company announced that it is adding support for “rel=me” links — a way to establish a relationship between two accounts by pointing links to each other. Here is how you can verify your Threads profile on Mastodon. Importantly, you have to follow the order for the verification to work. 1. Add your Mastodon profile to your Threads profile.
2. Add your Threads profile link to one of the “Extra fields” in your Mastodon profile.
3. Save the changes. The verification will likely appear on your Mastodon profile in the form of a green highlighted bar around the Threads link along with a check mark. You can see what the verification looks like in the screengrab below. Image Credits: Screenshot by TechCrunch When you complete the process, the Mastodon server essentially pings the Threads page to check for a “rel=me” web attribute and verify that the link in your Threads profile is pointing back to Mastodon. This “verification” only shows that you are the owner of the mentioned Threads profile and nothing else. Apart from Mastodon, you can also use this attribute to verify your Threads profile on services supporting the fediverse — a network of decentralized servers — such as Wikipedia, Gravatar, and Flipboard. However, this method is not working for some Mastodon users. A Threads engineer mentioned that the team is looking into verification-related bugs. Additionally, the engineer said that there is no way for you to verify your Mastodon profile on Threads at the moment. This update came with a slew of other features being added to Threads, including the ability to send a post directly to Instagram DMs, letting users add custom alt text for images, and a button to easily mention someone in a post. Instagram head Adam Mosseri also noted this update in his post and said it is one of the “meaningful steps towards adopting open standards and the fediverse.” He also said that the company has been using an “early version” of Threads on the web internally. This means we can get a fully functional desktop version of the social network in a few weeks. Last month, Mosseri said that because of technical challenges, the Threads app won’t support the fediverse at the launch. But he mentioned that the company is “fully committed to building support for ActivityPub.” Last year, after Elon Musk took over Twitter, developers built many link verification services for Mastodon as people were migrating to the fediverse."
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/disney-hotstar-lost-12-5-million-subscribers-in-a-quarter-amid-cricket-shortfall/,TechCrunch,Disney’s Hotstar loses 12.5M subscribers in a quarter amid cricket shortfall,"Disney+ Hotstar lost nearly a fourth of its customer base, or 12.5 million subscribers, in the quarter ending June, Disney disclosed in its earnings Wednesday, the ongoing setback at the India-focused streamer that’s reeling from the lack of cricket content. This is the third consecutive quarter in which Disney has lost subscribers. Hotstar had 40.4 million subscribers at the end of June, down about 21 million since October 2022. The fall in subscribers comes at a time when Disney is rumored to be exploring a sale or forming a joint venture for the broader India business. Bob Iger, Disney CEO, didn’t necessarily offer a strong India outlook on the earnings call. Asked how Disney+ Hotstar was shaping the company’s view on long-term international streaming strategy, and whether Disney was mulling exiting some markets, Iger said: Iger said Wednesday that Disney is considering “strategic options” for the company’s portfolio of TV networks. It also raised the price of its ad-free versions of Disney+ and Hulu by more than 20%, in what is the second cost hike this year. Hotstar, a crown jewel in Fox’s portfolio to become part of Disney with the acquisition, attracted tens of millions of customers in the past decade in part by providing livestreaming of cricket matches, particularly the local IPL tournament. That changed when Disney was outbid for the last season’s IPL digital rights by Viacom18, a company backed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries. To aggressively win customers, JioCinema streamed this year’s IPL for free in India. “In essence, this outcome allowed the new entrance of the country’s largest mobile telecom operator (backed by one the wealthiest men in the world) into a market once dominated by Disney. The defense of the linear business through securing IPL rights by Disney made little sense once Reliance introduced their IPL mobile product for free. As mobile operators in India like Vodafone have learned over the years, it has hard to compete with a local champion hellbent on disrupting the market with cut-rate or free offerings,” wrote boutique research house MoffettNathanson in a report last month."
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/google-opens-esignature-beta-for-google-docs-and-google-drive/,TechCrunch,Google opens eSignature beta for Google Docs and Google Drive,"Electronic signature has become table stakes for companies involved in document storage and management. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Google announced an open beta of its new-ish eSignature capability in Google Workspace today. The new feature will be available specifically for Google Docs and Google Drive for individual and various group accounts. The new feature, which had been in a limited alpha release up until now, is aimed at solopreneurs and small businesses as a way to easily collect and track digital signatures right in the document without printing, signing, scanning and emailing to get a signature. “To help streamline this workflow, we’re natively integrating eSignature in Google Docs, allowing you to request and add signatures to official contracts, directly in Google Docs,” the company wrote in a blog post announcing the new feature. It’s nothing fancy really. It’s just an electronic signature field that you can add to the document. Other capabilities expected to be added later this year could include an audit trail report to track signatures in Google Docs documents, the ability to deal with multiple signers and send documents to people outside the Google Workspace ecosystem, and finally, being able to grab an electronic signature in a PDF of the document. Image Credits: Google Box introduced a similar capability with Box Sign in 2021. Dropbox acquired HelloSign in 2019, but it does not bundle the feature like Box and Google. Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis, who has covered the document management space for many years, sees this move as Google just aligning with the market, and by offering it for free, giving customers the opportunity to make this part of their workflow. “It’s been on the cards now for a while that digital signature will become a bundled feature function. Box provides it as standard, now Google. Over time it’s likely Dropbox and Microsoft will do the same or at least provide an alternative to third party options,” he said. The company will be rolling out the new feature at no cost to individual Workspace users over the next 15 days. Various group users can participate by having their Workspace admins apply for the Beta."
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/china-tech-further-severed-from-us-fundings-after-biden-ban/,TechCrunch,China tech further severed from US fundings after Biden ban,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order barring U.S. investments in certain tech sectors of China, confirming months of rumors that Washington would ramp up efforts to squeeze China’s tech industry amid growing concerns over Beijing’s military ambitions. The order authorizes the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to restrict U.S. investment in three critical categories of Chinese companies: semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence that is critical for the military, intelligence, surveillance, or cyber-enabled capabilities as determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and other relevant agencies. The measure is expected to take effect next year, according to The Washington Post. It also applies to companies in Hong Kong. “Advancements in sensitive technologies and products in these sectors will accelerate the development of advanced computational capabilities that will enable new applications that pose significant national security risks, such as the development of more sophisticated weapons systems, breaking of cryptographic codes, and other applications that could provide these countries with military advantages,” the document reads. American venture investment firms first entered the Chinese market in the 1990s, assuming a critical role in funding the country’s burgeoning tech companies and facilitating their global expansion. But this once-cordial partnership now faces mounting challenges as U.S.-China tensions escalated in recent years, with both governments actively seeking to disengage their respective technology development from each other. “The U.S.’s restrictions on its domestic companies’ foreign investments to ‘decouple’ in the investment field under the guise of ‘de-risking’ deviate significantly from the principles of market economy and fair competition that the U.S. has long advocated,” a spokesperson from China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. “The ban greatly disrupts the normal pace of business decision-making, the international trade order, and the security of global supply chains.” American investment firms have been repositioning to navigate new geopolitical complications. Sequoia Capital China, which has raised over $16 billion across 36 funds and invested in over 1,000 companies, including behemoths like Alibaba, ByteDance and Shein, announced in June its decision to split its China arm into an independent unit. Now called HongShan, the Chinese operation greatly slowed its investment pace in recent times, recording just 70 investments during the four quarters between Q3 2022 and Q2 2023, compared to 180 deals from Q3 2021 to Q2 2022, according to Crunchbase. Other China-focused U.S. funds have adopted a “wait and see” approach, awaiting further clarification from the U.S. government, several investors told TechCrunch. Major U.S. endowments and foundations are also halting investments in China, one fund manager told TechCrunch. The venture capital firm is now raising a separate RMB fund to place bets on China’s high-tech firms, while its USD fund is directed only at U.S. companies. Meanwhile, some Chinese fund managers that previously raised capital from American limited partners are now turning to the Middle East for financing. Chinese startups are adjusting as well. Those that are targeting Western markets increasingly see the need to establish their controlling entity in the U.S. to attract American investors, according to a dozen founders TechCrunch spoke to in recent months. This marks a departure from the previous strategy of utilizing a variable interest entity (VIE) structure, which allowed foreign investors to buy into Chinese companies operating in restricted industries. However, even with U.S. investors on board, Chinese-founded startups face challenges in convincing U.S. regulators about the safety of American user data in Chinese hands. One needs look no further than TikTok’s struggles to reassure regulators in the West despite its efforts to build a wall between its user data and China-based teams."
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/krafton-commits-150-million-to-india-following-bgmi-trial-approval/,TechCrunch,Krafton commits $150 million to India following BGMI trial approval,"South Korean gaming firm Krafton plans to invest another $150 million in India over the next two to three years, it said in a boon to the local gaming ecosystem, roughly three months after securing permission to trial its popular battle royale game in the South Asian market following two bans. Thursday’s announcement follows Krafton investing about $140 million in 11 Indian startups and the local gaming ecosystem in the last three years. The company, whose Indian investments include Nodwin Gaming, Loco, Pratilipi, Kuku FM, told TechCrunch that it will use the additional $150 million to invest in gaming and entertainment startups. Krafton also said that it’s “implicitly happy with the performance” of existing India portfolio startups and most of them have grown their revenues multiple times and raised subsequent rounds. “We continue to hold a long-term view on India and its vibrant startup ecosystem, and we understand perfectly well that there are a number of reasons that can impact a company’s performance, including market conditions and consumer sentiment, among others, and we at Krafton will continue to support them,” the firm said. The new $150 million investment pledge comes at a time when Krafton’s BGMI (Battlegrounds Mobile India) mobile title has been permitted to operate in India, nearly a year after it was banned. The South Korean giant secured the three-month approval from the Indian authorities to resume operations of BGMI in May and the duration of the trial is set to expire in two weeks. BGMI itself is a revamped and localized version of PUBG, another popular title that was banned by New Delhi in mid-2020 over national security concerns. Krafton has made many significant business decisions — including cutting ties with Tencent as publisher and switching to Microsoft’s Azure for servers in India — to address New Delhi’s concerns. Nonetheless, the new announcement is a major boost for the local ecosystem. Krafton’s game is the most popular title in India and the linchpin of the country’s esports realm. As India grapples to attract ample investors in the gaming sector, Krafton’s steadfast support is a significant help. “We believe in the power of Indian IPs and content in making a lasting global impact, and we are excited to achieve new milestones in our journey to unlock the country’s full potential as a global gaming powerhouse,” said Sean Hyunil Sohn, chief executive of Krafton India. For Krafton, PUBG and its revamped India title, BGMI, remain among the most popular titles in its portfolio. And India remains a big market for the mobile battle royale games. In less than three months since the relaunch of BGMI, the title has amassed about 30 million monthly active users in the country, according to mobile intelligence firm SensorTower. The company said in an earnings call this week that BGMI is starting to generate revenue. The company said that the timing of its investment commitment and the conclusion of the BGMI trial are unrelated. “We will continue to invest and support the local ecosystem regardless of any conditions imposed on us. Krafton has invested close to $140 million since 2021 into the Indian startup ecosystem, and we expect to keep doing so, given that we have identified India as one of the premier engines of growth for Krafton globally,” a spokesperson said."
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/anthropic-launches-improved-version-of-its-entry-level-llm/,TechCrunch,Anthropic launches improved version of its entry-level LLM,"Anthropic, the AI startup co-founded by ex-OpenAI execs, has released an updated version of its faster, cheaper, text-generating model available through an API, Claude Instant. The updated Claude Instant, Claude Instant 1.2, incorporates the strengths of Anthropic’s recently announced flagship model, Claude 2, showing “significant” gains in areas such as math, coding, reasoning and safety, according to Anthropic. In internal testing, Claude Instant 1.2 scored 58.7% on a coding benchmark compared to Claude Instant 1.1, which scored 52.8%, and 86.7% on a set of math questions versus 80.9% for Claude Instant 1.1. “Claude Instant generates longer, more structured responses and follows formatting instructions better,” Anthropic writes in a blog post. “Instant 1.2 also shows improvements in quote extraction, multilingual capabilities and question answering.” Claude Instant 1.2 is also less likely to hallucinate and more resistant to jailbreaking attempts, Anthropic claims. In the context of large language models like Claude, “hallucination” is where a model generates text that’s incorrect or nonsensical, while jailbreaking is a technique that uses cleverly-written prompts to bypass the safety features placed on large language models by their creators. And Claude Instant 1.2 features a context window that’s the same size of Claude 2’s — 100,000 tokens. Context window refers to the text the model considers before generating additional text, while tokens represent raw text (e.g. the word “fantastic” would be split into the tokens “fan,” “tas” and “tic”). Claude Instant 1.2 and Claude 2 can analyze roughly 75,000 words, about the length of “The Great Gatsby.” Generally speaking, models with large context windows are less likely to “forget” the content of recent conversations. As we’ve reported previously, Anthropic’s ambition is to create a “next-gen algorithm for AI self-teaching,” as it describes it in a pitch deck to investors. Such an algorithm could be used to build virtual assistants that can answer emails, perform research and generate art, books and more — some of which we’ve already gotten a taste of with the likes of GPT-4 and other large language models. But Claude Instant isn’t this algorithm. Rather, it’s intended to compete with similar entry-level offerings from OpenAI as well as startups such as Cohere and AI21 Labs, all of which are developing and productizing their own text-generating — and in some cases image-generating — AI systems. To date, Anthropic, which launched in 2021, led by former OpenAI VP of research Dario Amodei, has raised $1.45 billion at a valuation in the single-digit billions. While that might sound like a lot, it’s far short of what the company estimates it’ll need — $5 billion over the next two years — to create its envisioned chatbot."
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/reddit-male-fashion-advice-mod-take-over-api-protest/,TechCrunch,Reddit’s menswear hub is the latest casualty of its battle with moderators,"The widespread protests against Reddit’s API changes reached a boiling point last month after the company forcibly reopened r/malefashionadvice — the largest subreddit that stayed dark after the blackout — booted the moderators, and appointed new ones.  The moderators of r/malefashionadvice (MFA) opted to keep the subreddit private after the blackout, despite warnings from Reddit to reopen it. When the moderators refused to comply, Reddit admins replaced the entire mod team with users who had little to no experience moderating fashion spaces. The subreddit has effectively fallen apart since the takeover.  Remaining subreddit members are mourning the loss of the accessible fashion community that r/malefashionadvice once provided. Reddit’s apparent disregard for its moderators, many of whom spend hours a day shaping subreddit culture, has been at the center of the clash between the company and its users. Subreddits that provide community and resources, meanwhile, are crumbling without the moderators and core users that kept them alive. With over 5.5 million subscribers, r/malefashionadvice is the most prominent casualty in Reddit’s power struggle with its moderators.  Derek Guy, the menswear writer known as dieworkwear, said that r/malefashionadvice has been “practically useless” since Reddit’s takeover. By pushing out moderators and alienating the power users who make up the core of these niche hobbyist communities, he said, Reddit is shutting down the few spaces that are welcoming to new hobbyists.  “At the end of the day, all of these communities are held together by the quality of the enthusiasts — people who do this stuff for the love of it — and you can’t replicate nerds who spend hours every day moderating debates about pants,” Guy tweeted.  In June, thousands of subreddits went dark to protest Reddit’s API pricing, which effectively shut down popular third-party apps like Apollo because of the high fees. Participating subreddits went private during the blackout, preventing users from posting or commenting, and shutting out non-subscribers from seeing the community entirely. The blackout lasted for 48 hours, with many subreddits opting to stay dark until Reddit rolls back its API changes. The protest has been largely led by unpaid moderators, who rely on third-party apps for moderation tools that Reddit lacks.  Since the blackout, Reddit has threatened to remove moderators who continue to participate in the protest, and has replaced top moderators in a slew of popular subreddits. Users in r/SubredditDrama and r/ModCoord are keeping track of subreddits undergoing “hostile takeovers,” including r/MusicTheory, r/Diving, r/Snackexchange, r/spotted, r/beyondthebump, r/Formula1, r/2meirl42meirl4meirl, r/Canning, and r/Piracy.  The former top moderator of r/beyondthebump, a subreddit for new parents, said they believed their removal was in retaliation for shutting down the subreddit during the blackout.  “I believe that even smaller moderators will be removed by the admin team over time,” they wrote in a r/ModCoord post. “Rather than being targeted, I believe that reddit saw the opportunity to remove me and took it.” A spokesperson for Reddit said that the company is enforcing the “moderator Code of Conduct,” and if mods “abandon” a community, Reddit will replace them with new mods. Public subreddits that have been indefinitely made private are considered “abandoned,” and Reddit has a practice of “reactivating private, high-subscriber communities that are being ‘camped’ on.” The Code of Conduct exists to ensure that mods aren’t acting against the interests of their community members, the spokesperson said.  “It’s also about protecting our users’ right to assemble and discuss topics they’re passionate about,” the statement to TechCrunch continued. “Redditors want to reddit, and mods want to mod. We want mods who want to mod to be able to do so.” 

			“The loss of MFA is part of a larger development online of making hobbies less accessible for people who are just starting out.”

 Protesting subreddits that went dark before Reddit forcibly opened them, like r/malefashionadvice, have pushed users to migrate to Discord and Substack to maintain their communities during the ongoing protest.  “Men’s fashion has gotten more expensive, the designs have gotten more conceptual. It’s just a less friendly environment to the guy who’s just trying to figure out how to dress in the office, and I think that’s terrible,” Guy told TechCrunch. “The loss of MFA is part of a larger development online of making hobbies less accessible for people who are just starting out.”  Unlike many fashion spaces online, r/malefashionadvice did not revolve around high-end, avant garde designs. Though many of the most popular posts portrayed users in very sophisticated, tasteful outfits, the majority of threads revolved around teaching guys how to dress for everyday life. It was one of the few fashion forums that incentivized constructive criticism and discouraged snark. In an increasingly snarky social media landscape, earnest communities like r/malefashionadvice are sorely needed to “make spaces feel welcoming to noobs,” Guy said.  One Reddit user described r/malefashionadvice’s default style recommendations as a “very specific blend of approachable and normie, but also in line with contemporary trends.” Other subreddits criticized r/malefashionadvice as “basic” — the default advice of pairing Uniqlo shirts with Clarks boots was a running joke both in and out of the subreddit — but as Guy pointed out, the “basic” uniform was inexpensive without looking cheap.  “It was the only forum where, if you were a guy and you have just no clue about anything about clothing, you could go there and find a sidebar full of useful resources,” Guy continued. “And you could ask questions, and very informed people with sophisticated knowledge and taste would help you.” On July 1, r/malefashionadvice went private. Two weeks later, Reddit admins requested that moderators open the subreddit within three days, or the company will remove them. Reddit removed the moderators on July 20, and then posted a call for new moderators.  “We more or less have been expecting the removal for the past few days,” a moderator identified as “Walker” told The Verge last month. The call for new moderators was heavily trolled by Reddit users. Comments applying for the vacant position, as archived on r/SubredditDrama, accused Reddit of wanting “fresh free labour to replace the old unpaid serfs,” and vowed that “this community will not accept scab mods.”  “I’ve never moderated anything in my life and I dress like a toddler, please make me a mod I promise that I’ll eat the boot and not just lick it,” another commenter said.  The moderators eventually appointed by Reddit have controversial post histories. Under the post announcing the new moderators, former r/malefashionadvice moderator GloriousStonerHoes pointed out that one of the appointed moderators had been banned from the subreddit multiple times. In the now-deleted comment, which has been archived in another post on r/SubredditDrama, the former moderator questioned why two of the new moderators were selected despite never posting on r/malefashionadvice before.  “MFA used to be a pretty tight-knit community where the moderators were not ‘power mods’ — most only modded mfa, a few modded one or two other fashion-related subs,” GloriousStonerHoes said.  He also noted that one of the newly appointed mods had made racist and xenophobic comments in r/britishcolumbia. That user has since been removed as a moderator of r/malefashionadvice.  Another former moderator known as trend_set_go criticized the new appointments as “peak sus.”  “This is a textbook definition of deposing old guard with someone who knows nothing of the history of the community,” trend_set_go said.  Now that the subreddit is open again, the r/malefashionadvice community is protesting the new moderator appointments by relentlessly trolling mod posts. Under a daily thread about fashion advice, a user asked, “what pair of shoes goes best with a black t shirt and slim fit chinos that i just pissed five minutes ago?”  Multiple Reddit-appointed moderators appeared to quit, or were removed, from r/malefashionadvice’s mod team. The community is now unmoderated, except for two bot accounts. Baffled users who weren’t up to date on the power struggle have asked the community to fill them in.  “What happened here?” one user asked in a post this week.  Migrating to the other menswear subreddits wasn’t an option, since those spaces revolve around more specific, high-end styles. Reddit user zerg1980 commented that r/malefashion, for example, “wouldn’t really help someone trying to dress better for work or for going out to dive bars.”  Guy described r/malefashionadvice as a “feeder” subreddit. Most fashion spaces are geared toward specific styles, from obscure streetwear brands to bespoke tailored suits to high-end Japanese denim. It’s difficult to wade through the sheer amount of niche discussions online when you’re just starting out, he said. General forums like r/malefashionadvice provide spaces for beginners to figure out what they like before they eventually migrate to more niche styles.  Users discussed forming a new subreddit, but others pointed out that the core of the community — who were well-versed in men’s fashion and could guide other users — were gone for good. The power users who were the most active, and typically the most helpful, would be hesitant to start another subreddit “because their problem is with Reddit,” Guy said.  Many subreddits are instead migrating to Discord. But Discord essentially functions as a chatroom, not as a forum, and sorts discussion in chronological order instead of vote count. Though topics in r/malefashionadvice’s Discord server are organized into different channels, advice and conversations can be lost in the countless messages. Reddit’s wealth of information is so vast that it’s often regarded as a better search engine than Google. Searching through Discord threads, on the other hand, is far more difficult than looking for information on Reddit.  “We are creating an environment where it’s very difficult for someone to get into this hobby because the information has become squirreled away,” Guy continued. “These forums have died. They’re shifted to Discord, which is not searchable.”  Former r/malefashionadvice moderator GloriousStonerHoes told TechCrunch that the subreddit’s Discord server is highly organized, and that Discord includes native features that were only available on Reddit by using third-party apps. The server’s questions and advice channel, for example, is a series of forum-like threads that are tagged as “Recommendations,” “Wardrobe overhaul,” “Dress code check,” “ID’ing items,” and more. “On Discord, you can search through messages from specific users, in specific channels, or from a specific time, which was a feature that was only possible on Reddit through third-party services,” he said. Those third-party services depended on the analytics and data collection platform Pushshift, which Reddit banned earlier this year because the site violated Reddit’s updated Data API terms. Reddit became so useful as a search tool because posts are indexed into Google, GloriousStonerHoes said, but its native search feature was “notoriously useless.” Most users instead used Google to search for information, and “appending ‘malefashionadvice’ to the end.” Discord messages aren’t indexed, which is a “major drawback,” so the server’s mods use the bot Answer Overflow to index threads. The mods also run a Substack of long-from content contributed by the community. The discontent is not exclusive to r/malefashionadvice. Reddit stamped out its user revolt, as Gizmodo reported, but in its Pyrrhic victory, may have irrevocably damaged its relationship with its users. Many subreddits just aren’t the same. Even though it didn’t capitulate to user demands, the site faces a worse prospect: losing relevance.  Users pointed out that the replacement moderators of these subreddits had little, if any, expertise in the topics they were tasked with moderating. One of the new moderators of r/Diving was torn apart for only having 21 dives under their belt — an amateur count compared to the hundreds of diving experiences that the previous moderators had. Some questioned if the moderator could provide accurate and safe guidance with such limited experience. Niche hobby spaces depend on power users who are willing to put in the time and effort to cultivate a community. Without knowledgeable moderators to guide discussions, subreddits are overtaken by “useless posts,” Guy said. Even if they don’t actively oppose Reddit’s API policy, if the most active users on a subreddit only see unhelpful or spam content, they won’t come back.  “So you then lose the second tier of people who don’t have a strong opinion about the original management issue, but they need to get something out of it. You only go back to the community if the discussion is interesting,” Guy said. “And if the discussion is no longer interesting, then you leave, and then as a result, the discussions get even worse because you’ve lost the second tier of high power users.”  The summer protests against Reddit may not have swayed Reddit’s policy changes. But they undoubtedly made an impact on the sense of community that once made Reddit so popular. Reddark, a site that tracks protesting subreddits, reports that at least 1,800 subreddits are still private or restricted, including r/fitness, r/bestof, r/meirl, r/curlyhair, r/streetwear, r/OnlyFans101 and r/ZeroWaste. Many subreddits are continuing to protest by going dark every Tuesday. In comments on r/ModCoord, users noted that their favorite subreddits are becoming flooded with spam and irrelevant posts because the moderators have stopped stepping in. Others said they’ve seen a drop in engagement on posts, and a decline in fresh content.  This week, a moderator of the still-dark r/Googlemaps asked for advice after receiving an ultimatum message from Reddit. User Sbatio told them that it’s their decision to comply by reopening the subreddit, but that Reddit as a site is “permanently damaged.”  “Reddit sucks since this all went down,” Sbatio replied. “They won but it’s dead.” "
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/what-led-to-ev-darling-proterras-bankruptcy/,TechCrunch,What led to EV darling Proterra’s bankruptcy,"Proterra, a company that develops battery systems for buses and other heavy duty EVs, filed for bankruptcy earlier this week, making it the latest in a string of failures in the EV sector. While some parallels can be drawn between Proterra and other failing or defunct EV companies, this company faces specific headwinds that took it down a rocky financial path. The bankruptcy filing came as a surprise for many. After all, Proterra was a company that was well-established — certainly no pre-revenue upstart — and a darling in the EV sector. It launched in 2004 as an electric transit bus company, a sector that seemed open for the taking and well positioned for growth. It raised millions from high-profile backers like Daimler and locked in deals with numerous cities. (As of August 2023, the company had delivered more than 1,000 electric transit buses, including 199 new transit buses and 14 pre-owned buses in 2022.) In 2015, Proterra diversified its business and decided to develop its own battery technology and powertrains. It eventually became a company with three business lines: battery systems called Powered, the Transit unit and a charging infrastructure business called Energy. Software services rounded out the mix. The company’s battery system business unit helped it expand beyond buses and into cargo vans, off-highway equipment that’s used in construction and mining, and even Class 8 semi-trucks. It has since installed more than 100 megawatts of heavy-duty EV charging infrastructure to support commercial vehicle fleets across North America. Things were going well enough that it went public in 2021 via a merger with special purpose acquisition company, in a deal was valued at $1.6 billion. So, how did Proterra wind up filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection? A tightening capital market didn’t help. Proterra burned through capital as it tried to scale its three businesses simultaneously. And then there are the special problems associated with companies that try to make a profit through sales to cities, and specifically transit agencies. Deals with transit agencies, which rely on federal and state funding, are slow to finalize and budgets are tight, which can mean reducing the price of a product to win a bid. That doesn’t help margins. On top of that pressure, Proterra doesn’t recognize revenue until it delivers those buses. Inflation rose in the meantime, further cutting into its margins. Contracts are typically signed 12 to 18 months prior to bus manufacturing, Proterra said in a day one declaration filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the District of Delaware. “Contracts signed in 2021 proved to be priced below where the manufacturing costs were ultimately realized in 2022,” the company noted. Making the situation even worse? Supply chain constraints, which led to delays significant enough that Proterra ended up paying penalties to contract supplier TPI Composites. Proterra said in the filing it was able to renegotiate the TPI contract to lessen the penalties to some degree, but it still faced liabilities from an inability to accept the agreed-upon bus body minimums. Proterra and TPI also faced penalties for delivering buses late to its customers. Atop all of these challenges, one of the bigger issues — and one that existed long before the economic conditions changed — are the special needs of transit agency customers. Every transit agency has different requirements for its buses, meaning every bus contract can have vastly different manufacturing requirements than the one before. “These transit agencies demand highly customized buses that align with the other buses in their respective fleets,” Proterra wrote in the filing. “Therefore, the manufacturing process requires much customization, which makes scaling the business difficult and requires an extensive amount of working capital.” Proterra still intends to continue as a business. Its hope — stated when it voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 — is that the move will “strengthen its financial position” through a recapitalization or going-concern sale. “The reorganization is intended to maximize the value of each independent business line,” said Proterra spokesperson Shane Levy told TechCrunch, noting that it’s in progress and the end result is unclear. The company said it will continue operations and will make a request to the bankruptcy court to use existing capital to pay employee salaries and compensating vendors and suppliers. In the meantime, Proterra has canceled its earnings call scheduled for August. The company said that Moelis & Company LLC is acting as Proterra’s investment banker, FTI Consulting as financial advisor, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP as legal advisor."
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/messina-joins-ride-home-funds-new-15m-ai-vehicle-backed-by-andreessen-dixon-crowley/,TechCrunch,"Messina joins Ride Home Fund’s new $15M AI vehicle, backed by Andreessen, Dixon, Crowley","Tech veteran Chris Messina and writer/podcaster Brian McCullough are launching a new $15 million fund aimed at AI startups. The backers include tech luminary investors and founders such as Marc Andreessen, Chris Dixon, and Dennis Crowley, who are all investing personally. McCullough has been running his Ride Home Fund for two years now, a fund which grew out of his hosting the Techmeme Ride Home podcast. Messina, formerly of Google, Uber, and a previous AI startup founder, is also famed as being the the inventor of the hashtag. Handily, he is also the number 1 product hunter on Product Hunt, which renders his ability to boost products fairly unique.  Over email, McCullough told me: “Not only has our inbound and deal flow switched to 90% AI, Chris was like: “The people coming off the bench right now are people that didn’t bite at crypto, didn’t bite at web3, but they’re going now and they’re people you would invest in whatever they’re doing next, by definition.”  He adds that given the layoffs at all the tech platforms, university graduates aren’t getting job offers from Big Tech companies any more, so they are punting for quick $100k to $500k checks to “just go with this AI idea” he says.  “It’s the best talent of the previous generation and the best talent of this generation pulling the trigger at the same time. It’s almost a perfect storm situation,” he added.  The fund plans to be the first check in at pre-seed or seed and deploy all its capital in the next 12-18 months. The 506c fund and fundraising will close on October 31. As a 506c fund, any accredited investors can become LPs, so long as they can stump up the minimum $100,000 required.  Messina is finally jumping to the VC side of the table after being a prolific angel investor. Over an email interview, I asked Messina  how investors are going to avoid the pitfall of the current AI hype cycle, which may well pull them into over-valued companies? “We believe this is a generational reset in how people use technology. Considering my experience building the social web, I see a similar shift now as I did back in 2005,” he said. “Generative AI changes how software will be built and used — beyond what the iPhone started 16 years ago. It lead to generational software companies like Airbnb and Uber (where I worked), which applied new technological capabilities (GPS, payments, notifications) to alter how people understood and coordinated transportation and housing.”  “We’re similarly bullish that companies that we invest in now will have a similar lead in redefining calcified industries. We’re investing in the productization of generative AI by founders who come equipped with tactical knowledge of vertical spaces like compliance or do-it-yourself repairs (yes, we’re writing checks already),” he added. However, given that the larger players in AI – the foundational platforms – are as big as they are, what will make it possible for small startups to compete against these leviathans? “The opportunities we’re investing in are too small and bespoke for the big incumbents to focus on,” he told me. “They’re creating general purpose platforms that can’t, by definition, be too finely trained on any particular application space. Furthermore, designing the best experiences with generative AI requires deep knowledge of and empathy with customers from specific industries  — both of which big tech companies typically lack (again, something I can speak to having worked at Google). They simply can’t move fast enough with sufficient product elegance to win the markets we believe are up for grabs,” he said. I also asked him what hurdles AI investors face, given there are already things such as the blocking of AI crawler bots happening. “We get people asking us all the time: where is the moat? Where will the value accrue? There are plenty of risks, but blocking AI crawler bots isn’t the top of that list. We think the people waiting for clear sailing are insane and will be kicking themselves in 18 months,” he added. Given Messina’s quite pivotal role at so many successful tech companies in the past, perhaps this is the signal that the AI startup boom really has now kicked off? "
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/creators-vow-not-to-scab-as-sag-aftra-wga-strikes-continues/,TechCrunch,"Creators vow not to scab as SAG-AFTRA, WGA strikes continue","As Hollywood’s writers and actors unions remain on strike, studios are turning to content creators to promote their movies and attend their screenings. But over 115 creators with a combined 80 million followers are pledging that they won’t cross the picket line while the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes rage on. “Before I was a creator, I used to work in restaurants full time, and that makes me no stranger to being exploited for my labor,” Jonathan Kung, a chef with 1.7 million TikTok followers, told TechCrunch. When Kung saw that TikToker and Gen Z for Change director Victoria Hammett was organizing creators to show solidarity with striking writers and actors, he immediately signed onto this pledge, which is called Labor Over Likes. “As content creators, we produce pretty much all the content we make. We are the writers, we are the talent, we are the producers,” Kung said. “Having that understanding of the entire process makes me realize how important every part of that process is.” Gen Z for Change, a youth political nonprofit, launched Labor Over Likes on Tuesday and continues to amass more signatures. The movement also seeks to educate creators about what role they play amid this larger labor struggle. Though some creators will proudly scab and take work from struck studios, others may simply not understand how they could be implicated. “We wanted to set a norm for other influencers, who are maybe less involved in labor movements… this is not for us to do,” TikTok creator and Gen Z for Change member Abbie Richards told TechCrunch. “Don’t cross the picket line, and make sure they understand that this could potentially harm their career down the line too.” Even though most creators aren’t part of these unions, they can be barred from joining them in the future if they work with struck studios and replace union labor. Those who sign on to Labor Over Likes are vowing to follow SAG-AFTRA’s influencer guidelines, which bar them from working with any AMPTP studios or promoting these companies’ work. So, for example, if an influencer took a brand deal to promote an upcoming Disney movie, they’d be in violation. “The lines between Hollywood and content creation have blurred to such a degree that I think we have to show solidarity,” Richards said. When the WGA last went on strike in 2007, internet personalities didn’t have nearly the same reach that they do today — at the time, Smosh had the most subscribers on YouTube with around 100,000. That’s still a substantial audience, but these days, some major creators have even larger audiences than Hollywood stars, making them an obvious target for studios that are struggling to promote their new releases. “There was a lot of concern at the start of the strike that those studios would be reaching out to non-union members and trying to get them to produce content for them to replace the striking writers and actors,” said Richards. “I think it’s important that in such a blended space — where we are all part of this much larger, amorphous blob of a creative content industry — that we’re quite clear that we’re not interested in doing that.”"
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/researchers-watched-100-hours-of-hackers-hacking-honeypot-computers/,TechCrunch,Researchers watched 100 hours of hackers hacking honeypot computers,"Imagine being able to sit behind a hacker and observe them take control of a computer and play around with it. That’s pretty much what two security researchers did thanks to a large network of computers set up as a honeypot for hackers. The researchers deployed several Windows servers deliberately exposed on the internet, set up with Remote Desktop Protocol, or RDP, meaning that hackers could remotely control the compromised servers as if they were regular users, being able to type and click around. Thanks to these honeypots, the researchers were able to record 190 million events and 100 hours of video footage of hackers taking control of the servers and performing a series of actions on them, including reconnaissance, installing malware that mines cryptocurrencies, using Android emulators to conduct click fraud, brute-forcing passwords for other computers, hiding the hackers’ identities by using the honeypot as a starting point for another attack, and even watching porn. The researchers said a hacker successfully logging into its honeypot can generate “tens of events” alone. “It’s basically like a surveillance camera for RDP system because we see everything,” Andréanne Bergeron, who has a Ph.D. in criminology from the University of Montreal, told TechCrunch. Bergeron, who also works for cybersecurity firm GoSecure, worked with her colleague Olivier Bilodeau on this research. The two presented their findings on Wednesday at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas. The two researchers classified the type of hackers based on Dungeons and Dragons character types. The “Rangers,” according to the two, carefully explored the hacked computers, doing reconnaissance, sometimes changing passwords, and mostly leaving it at that. “Our hypothesis is that they are evaluating the system they compromised so that another profile of attacker can come back later,” the researchers wrote in a blog post published on Wednesday to accompany their talk. The “Barbarians” use the compromised honeypot computers to try and bruteforce into other computers using known lists of hacked usernames and passwords, sometimes using tools such as Masscan, a legitimate tool that allows users to port-scan the whole internet, according to the researchers. The “Wizards” use the honeypot as a platform to connect to other computers in an attempt to hide their trails and the actual origin of their attacks. According to what Bergeron and Bilodeau wrote in their blog post, defensive teams can gather threat intelligence on these hackers, and “reach deeper into compromised infrastructure.” According to Bergeron and Bilodeau, the “Thieves” have the clear goal of monetizing their access to these honeypots. They may do that by installing crypto miners, programs to perform click fraud or generate fake traffic to websites they control, and selling access to the honeypot itself to other hackers. Finally, the “Bards” are hackers with very little or almost no skills. These hackers used the honeypots to use Google to search for malware, and even watch porn. These hackers sometimes used cell phones instead of desktop or laptop computers to connect to the honeypots. Bergeron and Bilodeau said they believe this type of hacker sometimes uses the compromised computers to download porn, something that may be banned or censored in their country of origin. In one case, a hacker “was downloading the porn and sending it to himself via Telegram. So basically circumventing a country-level ban on porn,” Bilodeau told TechCrunch. “What I think [the hacker] does with this then is download it in an internet cafe, using Telegram, and then he can put it on USB keys, and he can sell it.” Bergeron and Bilodeau concluded that being able to observe hackers interact with this type of honeypots could be very useful not just for researchers like them, but also law enforcement or cybersecurity defensive teams — also known as blue teams. “Law enforcement could lawfully intercept the RDP environments used by ransomware groups and collect intelligence in recorded sessions for use in investigations,” the researchers wrote in the blog post. “Blue teams for their part can consume the [Indicators of Compromise] and roll out their own traps in order to further protect their organization, as this will give them extensive documentation of opportunistic attackers’ tradecraft.” Moreover, if hackers start to suspect that the servers they compromise may be honeypots, they will have to change strategies and decide whether the risks of being caught are worth it, “leading to a slow down which will ultimately benefit everyone,” according to the researchers.

2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/trump-special-counsel-twitter-search-warrant/,TechCrunch,Special counsel secured a secret search warrant for Trump’s Twitter account,"New court papers first reported by Politico reveal that the special counsel investigating former President Trump secured a search warrant for his Twitter account back in January. The documents, which were unsealed Wednesday, show that prosecutors exploring Trump’s role in the January 6 attack extended their search to Trump’s communications over social media — particularly the platform he used to direct insurrectionists at the Capitol that day. “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,” Trump wrote in a tweet as events at the Capitol unfolded. “USA demands the truth!” A federal judge signed the search warrant in January and allowed prosecutors to secretly obtain access to the Twitter account to preclude giving Trump “an opportunity to destroy evidence, change patterns of behavior, [or] notify confederates,” according to the documents. Trump’s tweets were cited widely in Special Counsel Jack Smith’s indictment of the former president, revealed last week. Smith charged Trump with four felonies related to his alleged efforts to overturn and undermine the results of the 2020 U.S. election. In light of his activity on the platform, Twitter permanently banned the then-president on January 8, 2021. After taking over at the company and rebranding it X, current owner Elon Musk reversed the ban and reinstated Trump’s account. The former president, who is again running in 2024, never returned to Twitter and now speaks directly to his followers on Truth Social. “Just found out that Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ secretly attacked my Twitter account, making it a point not to let me know about this major “hit” on my civil rights,” Trump posted to Truth Social on Wednesday. “… Did Deranged Jack Smith tell the Unselects to DESTROY & DELETE all evidence? These are DARK DAYS IN AMERICA!” It’s not immediately clear from the unsealed search warrant why the special counsel sought access to Trump’s Twitter. The search warrant presumably would give the investigation access to his DMs, but also might help the investigation confirm the provenance of any tweets issued on January 6 from the account. Twitter apparently dragged its feet in complying with the special counsel’s search warrant, providing the requested information behind the deadline. The delay resulted in the court holding Twitter in contempt and a $350,000 fine, after the company apparently unsuccessfully objected to the nondisclosure order paired with the request. A few details in the newly unsealed papers suggest that the normal pathways for legal requests at the company now known as X were dysfunctional as of January. “The government faced difficulties when it first attempted to serve Twitter with the warrant and nondisclosure order,” according to the documents. “On January 17, 2023, the government tried to submit the papers through Twitter’s website for legal requests, only to find out that the website was inoperative.”"
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/beacon-demo-day-s23-cohort/,TechCrunch,Beacon’s latest demo day startups are a bet that the future might be multichain,"Beacon, an early-stage web3 accelerator program, held its second cohort graduation on Wednesday. The demo day launched in tandem with its VC database, which opened to the public amid ongoing capital restraints in a bear market. The teams in the second cohort, its Summer 2023 group (Cohort S23), presented their startups during the demo day, exclusively covered by TechCrunch+. We also covered its first Cohort demo day in January, which it styled as “Cohort 0.” That one featured 13 startups. Cohort S23 consists of 10 companies, built by 25 founders across three countries and 12 cities. Unlike Y Combinator, Beacon doesn’t select only the companies that are the most nascent. “The accelerator focuses on web3 but looks at everything within the industry from pre-seed and Series A,” said Sam Lehman, core contributor at Beacon. The three-month program runs twice a year and accepts about 15 to 20 applicants for its fall and spring cohorts. Kenzi Wang, another core contributor for Beacon, shared that the cohort had about 40 mentors, including: Jack Lu, CEO and co-founder of Magic Eden; Neil Cunha-Gomes, head of EMEA fintech at SoftBank Vision Fund; and Dan Kim, VP of business development at Coinbase. Venture capitalists from CoinFund, Variant, Electric Capital, Pantera, Lightspeed, Galaxy Interactive and others also served as mentors. Prospective startups are not tied to any particular blockchain, making Beacon’s program open to anyone in the crypto market. “We definitely take a multi-chain future view at Beacon, so most of our projects are building multi-chain or chain-agnostic products,” Lehman said in an email to TechCrunch+. “That said, stuff in the EVM world is definitely still the hottest.” The startups focused on a range of crypto subsectors like infrastructure, gaming, decentralized social media and DeFi, to name a few. The majority of the startups in the cohort are seed stage, with two at pre-seed and one company, Phaver, at Series A. But the new startup group (notes below) was not all that Beacon had on offer this week. Beacon VC Database is a tool initially used internally by the group to help founders in its accelerator program find funds actively deploying capital into web3 startups. As of today, the platform features over 200 funds, including generalist funds with a crypto arm like a16z and Lightspeed, along with pure crypto-focused funds invested in the space like Dragonfly and Blockchain Capital. It also includes micro funds around $10 million to mega funds with over $1 billion in assets under management, Lehman noted. “We built it because we kept hearing the same questions: ‘Which funds are deploying into game content right now?’ or ‘Do you know any funds that would lead a round for a security focused company at a seed stage?’” Lehman said. While venture databases are not rare — PitchBook, Crunchbase, Dealroom, etc. — they are often generalized and thus less precise for subniche categories of a startup. Beacon plans to progressively decentralize the database over time to allow investors to “claim” their records to update it in real time, the accelerator said in a statement.

While HawkEye declined to name its propulsion provider to TechCrunch, an April 2022 letter from HawkEye to the FCC states that the affected satellites are equipped with Enpulsion’s IFM Nano Thruster propulsion system. HawkEye requested temporary permission from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to operate three of its satellites, called Cluster 4, at a lower altitude on July 24. In a separate filing, the company requested permanent authority to operate its constellation at orbital altitudes of 400-615 kilometers, given the propulsion failures. “The Cluster 4 spacecraft are currently operating at an orbital altitude of approximately 477 km, as a result of failures in the propulsion systems of each of the Cluster 4 spacecraft,” the company said in its request. “The company has unsuccessfully tried to remedy these failures and recently concluded that the propulsion system failures are irreparable.” HawkEye has already discontinued use of Enpulsion’s systems: in March, the FCC approved HawkEye’s request to switch to a water-based propulsion system made by Bradford Space starting with Cluster 7 and on all future satellites. The company launched Cluster 7 to orbit in April, bringing its constellation to 21 spacecraft (including the three experiencing issues here). According to NASA, we are currently approaching solar maximum, or the time in the solar cycle when the sun’s activity peaks. This activity, which can include powerful geomagnetic storms, can create issues for spacecraft, including increased drag that accelerates their orbital decay. TechCrunch reported last week that some Capella Space satellites were starting to prematurely deorbit due to solar activity and issues with third-party propulsion. In a statement to TechCrunch, HawkEye confirmed that the Cluster 4 satellites are otherwise functional. “The Cluster 4 satellites are not in danger of deorbiting and continue to collect data and actively service our customers,” the company said. “They were deployed at a lower altitude and had a propulsion system anomaly which has shortened potential mission life, but the satellites are still expected to operate within the tolerance of their design life. Our overall constellation architecture is robust and provides for variation in mission life for our clusters based on deployment altitude, anomalies, and space weather.” Update: Enpulsion CEO Alexander Reissner said, “The root cause of the HawkEye anomalies was pinpointed in a constructive and collaborative investigation between our teams. It was the combined result of specific operational mission needs together with the specific atmospheric environment of the constellation that eventually led to the current non-operative state. A worst case that is unfortunately almost impossible to reproduce on ground and was therefore not covered in initial verification tests. Building on actionable findings, we correlated what happened to Cluster 4 and the other few documented in-orbit anomalies that occurred in the first years of our orbit heritage to the same root cause. Since then, mitigation measures were defined for thrusters exposed to this risk and no new failure mechanism has been encountered since then, during a total accumulated on-orbit time of active propulsion systems of > 58 years.”"

Redwood does recycle battery cell components and sells them back to manufacturers, but it also produces anode and cathode components for lithium-ion batteries — and building a sustainable, closed-loop domestic supply chain to fuel electric vehicles. The company scored a big win earlier this year, landing a conditional commitment for a $2 billion loan from the Department of Energy as part of the Biden administration’s bid to build up a supply chain for EVs in the United States. Responsible for some of Tesla’s most important technology, notably around batteries, Straubel returned to the company last May after shareholders elected him to its board of directors. Don’t miss what’s sure to be an important conversation on the future of sustainable electric vehicles. Prior to founding Redwood Materials, JB Straubel was a co-founder of Tesla, where he spent 15 years as chief technology officer and built one of the best engineering teams in the world. Among many areas, he led cell design, supply chain and the first Gigafactory concept through the production ramp of the Tesla Model 3. Straubel played a direct role in both R&D, team building and operational expansion from prototype cars through to mass production and GWh-scale. He received his MS in engineering and a BS in energy systems engineering from Stanford University. He left Tesla in 2019 to focus on Redwood Materials. But now he’s back at the U.S. automaker as a board member. TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 takes place in San Francisco on September 19–21. You can save up to $600, but the deadline is August 11 at 11:59 p.m. PDT. Hurry and buy your Disrupt pass today! Is your company interested in sponsoring or exhibiting at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023?

2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/free-ad-supported-tv-streaming-services-are-booming-1-in-3-u-s-viewers-tune-in/,TechCrunch,"Free ad-supported TV streaming services are booming, 1 in 3 U.S. viewers tune in","As more consumers look to cut costs and opt for a free streaming experience, services like Freevee, Pluto TV, Tubi, the Roku Channel and Crackle are seeing significant growth. According to Samba TV’s latest State of Viewership report, 1 in 3 U.S. users subscribe to free ad-supported TV streaming (FAST) services. Notably, Amazon’s Freevee saw the highest viewership growth in the first half of 2023 compared to competitors, as it was up 11% year-over-year. Amazon has recently ramped up its focus on the FAST market, bringing hundreds of Amazon Original titles from Prime Video to Freevee, as well as 23 new ad-supported TV channels from Warner Bros. Discovery and MGM. Meanwhile, Pluto and Tubi were up 7% and 6%, respectively, whereas the Roku Channel and Crackle were both up 5%. Fox-owned Tubi touted in its earnings call yesterday that its total consumption grew by 79%, further highlighting the demand for FAST services among viewers.  When we compared this to SVOD (subscription video-on-demand) streamers, a few major platforms saw declines. For instance, Netflix dropped 1% YoY, and Peacock saw a 2% decrease in viewership (maybe don’t kill your free tier, Peacock). Even Freevee’s sister streaming service, Prime Video, had a mediocre rise in viewership at only 3% YoY. Cheaper ad-supported streaming options are also being favored over SVOD services. Samba TV reported that 1 in 4 premium streaming subscribers pay for an ad-supported subscription in 2023. Sixty percent of U.S. adults said they would consider subscribing to a “discounted” streaming service if it meant viewing ads, Samba TV added. The recent findings come less than a year after Netflix and Disney+ introduced their ad tiers. According to the report, 85% of participants who are Netflix and Disney+ subscribers said that they signed up for the ads plan soon after it launched. Netflix boasted the success of its ad-supported tier during its first Upfront presentation, revealing that, as of May 2023, the plan has nearly 5 million global monthly active users. For the second quarter of this year, Antenna recently reported that 17% to 20% of new Netflix signups were for the ad tier. Prime Video may also be getting an ad-supported tier, according to The Wall Street Journal, which reported in June that the e-commerce giant apparently considered an option where existing subscribers would automatically get ads and would have to pay more for ad-free content. “Streaming first hit audiences as an ad-free, content-when-you-want-it replacement to cable,” Samba TV writes. “But, as these a la carte streaming options swell, audiences are open to welcoming ads back in if it lowers their monthly costs.” If premium streaming services continue to hike up their subscription prices, it won’t be a surprise to anyone if this trend of FAST and ad-supported streaming continues its ascent."
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/cpuc-vote-to-define-cruise-waymo-robotaxi-future-in-san-francisco/,TechCrunch,California regulators to decide the future of Cruise and Waymo,"The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is scheduled Thursday to make a high-stakes vote that will determine the commercial future for autonomous vehicle technology companies Cruise and Waymo — not to mention any other AV company with aspirations to launch commercial robotaxi services in the state. Cruise and Waymo already offer limited commercial services in San Francisco. If the CPUC grants Cruise and Waymo its final permits, the two companies will be able to charge for all rides, expand hourly operations and service area, and add an unlimited number of robotaxis to their fleets.  California is a paradox for the AV industry. The state is a hub of tech activity with large concentrations of AV engineers located in and near the Bay Area, making it a natural place for development and testing. It gets tricky, however, once a company wants to deploy commercial operations in California, a state with some of the strictest autonomous vehicle regulation in the country. A “no” vote would certainly delay, if not completely derail, Cruise’s and Waymo’s plan to launch commercial operations in the state. That could accelerate plans to expand in other cities like Phoenix, where Waymo has long operated and where Cruise is starting to push into. The CPUC’s decision Thursday could also influence how other cities choose to regulate the growth of AVs. Developing, testing and deploying AV tech isn’t cheap, and the only way to reach positive unit economics is to scale. Waymo has already had to pull back on operations this year after Alphabet issued a slew of layoffs in the first quarter. In July, the company shut down its self-driving trucks program to shift all its available resources to ride-hailing. Back in May, the CPUC had all but granted the expansion permits, then delayed the final vote twice amid mounting opposition from city agencies and residents. Since AVs hit the streets of San Francisco, there have been numerous instances of vehicles malfunctioning and stopping in the middle of the street — referred to as “bricking” — blocking the flow of traffic, public transit and emergency responders.  “This technology is still in development and is simply not ready to operate 24/7 in the city,” reads a statement from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). “Several minutes of driverless AV stalled on Muni rail tracks can cause several hours of disrupted transit service.” Opponents to the expansion are urging caution and incremental growth. They’re also calling for more transparent data sharing from the AV companies. Today, AV companies are only required to report collisions and not the many incidents of bricking. Cruise and Waymo argue that SF’s streets are unsafe and that AV technology can save lives. Cruise has said that, in simulation, its AVs were involved in 92% fewer collisions as the primary contributor and 54% fewer collisions overall when benchmarked against human drivers in comparable driving environments. Screenshot from CPUC meeting displaying AV incidents reported. Image Credits: SFFD, SFPD, SFMTA During a meeting with the CPUC on Monday to discuss how AVs interact with first responders, Waymo said it has about 100 vehicles on the road at any given time, and about 250 on its equipment list. Cruise said it has roughly 300 vehicles operating at night and 100 during the daytime in San Francisco.  The companies also shared data on instances in which someone from their team had to go and physically move a bricked AV, which they referred to as a “vehicle retrieval event” or VRE. According to Cruise’s data, from January 1 to July 18, 2023, there were 177 VREs, and of those, 26 occurred when a passenger was in a vehicle. Only two VREs involved first responders, and the average resolution time was clocked at 14 minutes. Waymo had a slightly better go of it, but that could be because the company has fewer vehicles on San Francisco’s roads. From January 1 to June 30, Waymo recorded 58 retrieval events and said it averages 10 minutes to retrieve bricked vehicles.  City officials have said that VREs only make up a subset of the total number of unexpected stops but that it’s difficult to know exactly how many of such stops there have been because Cruise and Waymo don’t share their data, and any data they do share is redacted.  “Given that we do not have actual data, what we have is information from reports that have been made by members of the public, by city employees, by firefighters, by transit operators,” said Julia Friedlander, senior manager of automated driving policy at the SFMTA, at Monday’s meeting with the CPUC. “And what we have seen is that things are not getting better. The monthly rate of incidents has been growing significantly over the course of 2023. You’ll see that June was the month with the highest number of incidents of all kinds.” Between April 2022 and April 2023, the SFMTA collected a total of 261 incidents involving a Cruise vehicle and 85 incidents involving a Waymo vehicle. Those incidents include multiple types of driving behavior, including unexpected stops, erratic driving, issues with pickup and drop-off, and collisions.  According to the San Francisco Police Department, between June 2022 and June 2023, Cruise vehicles were involved in 30 collisions, six of which resulted in injuries. Waymo vehicles had two collisions, one of which resulted in an injury.  San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) chief Jeanine Nicholson said Monday that the SFFD has recorded 55 reports of interference in 2023. Nicholson said these include things like unexpected stops in front of fire stations that prohibit emergency vehicles from responding to incidents in a timely manner and vehicles coming into scenes in an “unsafe and unpredictable manner.” Screenshot from CPUC meeting displaying two instances when AVs did not respond to first responders. Image Credits: SFFD, SFPD, SFMTA The SFFD has reported incidents of AVs’ rooftop sensors getting entangled with electrical wires after the cars ignored warning signs and yellow emergency tape; blocking firehouse driveways; sitting motionless on one-way streets and causing emergency vehicles to back up while responding to incidents; pulling up behind fire trucks with emergency lights on and interfering with firefighters unloading ladders; and entering an active fire scene and parking on top of a fire hose.  During Monday’s meeting, Nicholson said that the SFFD and other city agencies had been told by Waymo and Cruise that if an AV bricks in an active emergency zone, first responders can get in touch with their customer service and AV field support teams, or they can get in and take over the vehicle to move it.  “It is not the responsibility of my people to get in one of your vehicles and take it over,” Nicholson said. “It is the responsibility of the autonomous vehicle companies to not have them impact us in the first place . . . our folks cannot be paying attention to an autonomous vehicle when we’ve got ladders to throw.” Cruise is working to get regulatory approval to deploy its purpose-built Origins, which are built without steering wheels or pedals. Those would be impossible for a first responder to move without towing them away. “If we are blocked by an autonomous vehicle, a fire can double in size in a minute that could lead to more harm to the people in that building and to the housing overall, and my first responders will be going into a more advanced fire,” Nicholson continued. “It can also lead to worse outcomes on a medical level.” Jarvis Murray, for-hire transportation administrator for the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), pointed out Monday a range of other risks. Waymo has begun testing its AVs in Los Angeles but will require an additional permit from the CPUC to start a commercial service there. In addition to blocking traffic and first responders, Murray said that LA agencies were concerned about technical failures like  software glitches or sensor malfunctions leading to accidents or unexpected behavior, as well as cybersecurity threats.  City agencies have complained that they do not receive enough data from AV companies regarding unexpected stops. Image Credits: SFFD, SFPD, SFMTA Most of the city agencies that spoke during Monday’s meeting with the CPUC agree that AV technology has the potential to save lives, improve traffic and reduce greenhouse gas emissions — just not quite yet.  Before issuing any permits, the SFMTA argued that the CPUC should collect better and new AV data (including unexpected stops and duration of the stops) and create a performance evaluation framework and methods for analysis of the data. The CPUC could then authorize the incremental expansion of AV services using that framework and the data collected. “In our view, two-way data information sharing would allow cities to note areas where these unexpected stops continuously occur, and this would allow us to evaluate the street design in that area,” said Murray of LADOT. “But without this type of data and information, cities are frankly powerless to assist the companies and the communities and alleviate these concerns.”"
2023-08-09,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/app-store-payment-rules-wont-change-as-apples-battle-with-epic-games-heads-to-supreme-court/,TechCrunch,App Store payment rules won’t change as Apple’s battle with Epic Games heads to Supreme Court,"Apple’s current App Store rules will continue to stand, as its case with Fortnite maker Epic Games heads to the Supreme Court — meaning developers won’t be able to redirect customers to their own payment systems anytime soon. The two tech giants have been battling over Apple’s requirement to use its in-app payments system, its commission structure, as well as its alleged monopolistic practices — something the lower courts found not to be the case. Epic had asked that the federal appeals court’s most recent decision would stand while the case was argued at the nation’s highest court, but that request has now been denied. If granted, Apple would have been forced to allow App Store apps the option to offer their own links or buttons to non-Apple payment systems, effectively permitting developers to circumvent Apple’s 15% to 30% commissions on purchases and subscriptions. Though Apple largely won its antitrust case in the lower courts, the rules around in-app payments were the one area where it lost — and why it continues to fight. After the case reached the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the justices upheld a lower court’s judgment in favor of Epic under California’s Unfair Competition Law. This decision would have impacted Apple’s ability to set “anti-steering” rules for its App Store that today restrict developers from even pointing to other options to pay besides Apple’s own payments system. Epic, naturally, wanted that ruling to stand, despite its continued legal battle. Not surprisingly, the court said no. Prior to this, Apple had been granted a motion that put the appeals court ruling on a temporary 90-day hold as it filed its appeal to the Supreme Court. Bloomberg first reported the news of the Supreme Court’s decision, noting that Justice Elena Kagan decided not to let the appeals court decision go into effect. However, if the top court’s justices refuse to hear the case, then the ruling will stand, the report said."
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/made-renovation-promised-tech-enabled-remodels-customers-describe-absolute-nightmare/,TechCrunch,Made Renovation promises ‘tech-enabled’ remodels; customers describe ‘absolute nightmare’,"Last year, Jonas Heineman was overseeing a team of commercial project managers as they installed hundreds of electric vehicle charging stations. Heineman’s wife was also pregnant with their first child. Given his busy days and evenings filled with planning for the couple’s growing family, the last thing that Heineman wanted was to spend his “off” hours managing yet another another construction project at his own Bay Area home. Even as he and his wife discussed renovating two older bathrooms, he knew himself well enough to know that “I’m not going to design things. I didn’t want to go and source materials.” Then he stumbled across coverage of a San Francisco startup called Made Renovation that promised bathroom remodels “made easy.” Wanting exactly the kind of hand-holding it promised, he couldn’t believe his luck. Yet his enthusiasm would soon be squelched. Founded in 2019, Made Renovation assures customers that it can transform their outdated bathrooms into showstoppers within months at an affordable price point. How? By inviting them to choose from a variety of templates, then pairing them with in-house project managers who help with required permits, assign contractors, order the required materials, and offer updates and assistance virtually until every renovation is complete. It’s a compelling pitch, one that enabled Made Renovation to raise at least $31 million across two rounds of funding between 2020 and 2021 from investors Felicis, Founders Fund, Insight Partners, and actress-entrepreneur Jessica Alba among some others who liked its tech-driven approach. A minimalist and highly popular aesthetic helps, too. Made Renovation’s sleek website offers virtual tours of a dozen bathrooms, all with gleaming tile, modern fixtures and magazine-worthy vanities. For its efforts, the company has attracted both customers and some glowing press. In 2021, in Made Renovation’s second year of operations, Architectural Digest wrote that the outfit was “primed to be the largest bathroom remodeler” and touted its digital tools for “more efficient project management, design renderings, and an improved pricing algorithm.” Tech can only do so much, however, and Made Renovation’s promises of smoothly remade powder rooms are seemingly colliding with the realities of construction complexities, turning some of its makeovers into anything but hassle-free endeavors. Says Heineman now of his own experience, “It was a joke.” While promised project management, for example, Heineman says that Made Renovation later disbanded its project management team without alerting him and spun the cost-cutting development as a positive for customers. The company subsequently sent Heineman a downloadable “Self-Management Construction Support Guidebook” that he describes as a “thorough resource” and also beside the point of why he chose Made Renovation in the first place. Other errors, delays, oversights, and cost overruns also became par for the course, judging by email correspondence seen by TechCrunch. One issue centered on a toilet that was shipped eight months late; Heineman says he was also sent faulty fixtures that he struggled to return, and lost the first general contractor who was sent by Made Renovation because this individual refused to take on the job for the agreed-upon amount of money. Heineman didn’t blame him; he thinks it’s the fault of Made Renovation. “That’s why they end up with these subpar contractors,” he says. “The only people willing to take these jobs for a cut rate can’t do business development and suck at communicating with customers.” Heineman isn’t alone in feeling like he was sold on a vision that vanished as soon as he became Made Renovation’s customer. Airbnb employee Deanna Bjorkquist says she, too, was abruptly left to fend for herself when her bathroom project ran into permitting issues, unexpected construction hurdles, and the question of where to warehouse materials. For example, Made Renovation didn’t launch her bathroom remodel until six months after she signed a contract with the company last October, stranding a new toilet in her living room in the interim. She also says a general contractor assigned to her project refused to demolish her old bathroom, dismantling only the top half and moving forward only after she found and paid a separate drywall company to finish the job.  As with Heineman, a bevy of other problems ensued, says Bjorkquist, including payments made to Made Renovation that were not received by the people renovating her bathroom. She suggests that part of the problem ties to the fact that the contractor who was assigned to her home hired a subcontractor, as happened with Heineman. Further, she says she elected to use financing that was offered, then revoked, then reinstated again by Made Renovation through a third party, a stressful process during which she says she was warned that her credit might be damaged. Her bathroom (pictured right) was still not complete as of late last month. In fairness, Made Renovation is taking on an industry where few customers wind up fully satisfied, no matter the players involved. Further, its timing couldn’t be worse. To enable customers to check out its design ideas, it launched its very first storefront in a popular shopping district of San Francisco in February 2020, roughly one month before the pandemic caused most of the U.S. to shut down. Asked several times to discuss some of his customers’ complaints, CEO Roger Dickey did not respond. Investors don’t have much to say, either. Felicis partner Sundeep Peechu told TechCrunch late last month via email, “We are a small seed investor but honestly don’t know much since [I’m] not on the board and don’t get updates.” A query sent to Nikhil Sachdev, a managing director at Insight Ventures who led Made Renovation’s $23 million Series A round in 2021, has not been met with a response. Felicis lists Made Renovation on its website; the brand does not appear on the sites of either Insight Partners or Founders Fund. Made Renovation wasn’t alone in springing up amid the national housing boom that ended last year, when interest rates began to quickly rise. Though most startups to form are marketplace businesses that connect designers and contractors to customers, another company to emerge around the same time as Made Renovation — with similar promises to make bathroom renovations easier and affordable — is Block Renovation. The Brooklyn-based business raised $104 million over a series of quick funding rounds between 2018 and 2021. Block has since expanded into kitchen remodels. Both have been chasing what is expected to become an $80 billion market by 2027. But Made Renovation seems unlikely to see much of that market share if customer complaints continue to stack up. On HomeAdvisor, a digital marketplace that connects service professionals with customers, Made Renovation has received half a star (out of five) across seven reviews listed. Made Renovation is “[w]here dreams of great-looking bathroom remodeling and belief in seamless project management go to die,” writes one reviewer. “Absolute nightmare of an experience!” writes another. Seventeen reviews on the Better Business Bureau website are just as uncharitable. Writes one reviewer: “I wish I read these reviews before we started the project with Made Renovation . . . All was going extremely well until we transferred money. After that it went downhill.”"
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/micromax-india-ev-smartphone/,TechCrunch,Micromax eyes a steer into electric vehicles,"Micromax Informatics once had a firm grip on the local mobile phone market in India, for a time passing stalwarts like Samsung, icons like Apple and many more to be the biggest handset maker of them all. But a mix of stronger (and cheaper) competition, the rapid pace of technology development and the ongoing market slowdown have left it spinning. While some believe that it still has some life in it yet as a mobile brand, sources and filings point to something else: It’s eyeing to step into mobility, specifically into the area of electric vehicles. But that change in gears is also coming with a lot of bumps. TechCrunch understands that the New Delhi–based company has axed dozens of jobs both at its headquarters in Gurugram as well as branch offices across the country, cutting into its ranks in sales, product, testing, R&D and logistics, and the rest of the business. Several top executives, including the company’s chief business officer and chief product officer, have also resigned in the last some months. Its most recent smartphone model launched as far back April 2022. Micromax declined to comment about the job cuts and other details of this story. To the public, for now, the company remains a mobile phone company, although many cracks are showing. Reports on social media show the company’s reluctance to handle consumer complaints. Distributors and retailers are having a hard time with their inventory because there is little demand for Micromax phones from consumers. And basic searches on the Micromax brand on Google from 2008 — its first year in mobile — lay bare the general decline in chatter about the company. There have also been reports about how the company is gearing up, among other similarly struggling older brands, to redouble its efforts to recover. “[The] market is very competitive now, focused around the top five or six brands,” said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at market research firm IDC. Micromax, having dropped from its position at the top of that list, is as good as forgotten. The EV move would come in the form of a new brand and focus, at least initially, on two-wheel electric vehicles, according to three individuals who recently left the company. A shift to urban mobility from mobile phones would not be the first time that Micromax reinvented itself. Founded in 2000 by Vikas Jain, Rahul Sharma, Sumit Kumar Arora and Rajesh Agarwal, Micromax first started life as a small IT firm, making its first move into phones only in 2008. The initial journey of the company relied on low-cost feature phones. Affordable Android smartphones and tablets entered the frame some time after, dovetailing with a rising consumer class in India that wanted the latest gadgets but didn’t have the money to buy a Samsung, Nokia or BlackBerry device — let alone an iPhone. The company chose a price disruption strategy to swiftly dethrone Samsung from its leadership position in the Indian smartphone market, making it one of the trailblazers in the first wave of cheap, sub-$200 smartphones. Utilizing its supply chain in China, Micromax launched a range of inexpensive smartphones and tablets that attracted the masses, tapping directly into their aspirational inclinations: Some models directly mimicked Apple’s iconic iPhone designs. In 2014, Micromax poached Samsung’s country head for mobile and digital imaging Vineet Taneja and appointed him the CEO. By 2015, it was selling millions of mobile phones a month and generating around a couple billion dollars in revenues in a year. The growth in its business helped the company partner with Big Tech companies like Google and Microsoft to launch smartphones based on their respective mobile operating systems. The first market problems started in 2014, when Xiaomi and other Chinese vendors started to get considerably more focused on India, disrupting Micromax in the same way that Micromax had disrupted Samsung before it: with highly affordable, Chinese-made models across different price segments. Having been a trailblazer by manufacturing some of its models in India, Micromax also worked closely with Chinese suppliers like Tinno Mobile to bring newer lines of low-cost smartphones to the market. It wasn’t enough, though, and by 2016, Taneja was out. “China-based vendors managed to get quality devices, high specifications and the latest technology at affordable prices with huge marketing and channel spends,” Singh said. “Indian vendors were just not able to compete in any of these levers — product, marketing, channel, etc. As a result, they lost the market to brands like Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo and Samsung.” Micromax was challenged also due to a state-level move. The Indian government, in September 2014, introduced its flagship “Make in India” program, schemes to incentivize global manufacturers to localize production in the country. Newer market entrants, taking the domestic manufacturing route with its tax breaks and other incentives, started to roll out even cheaper handsets. The third big blow came in September 2016, when billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries introduced Jio, its 4G network. Testing on the network was closed to a select group of brands. And Micromax — with no 4G-ready handsets given its focus on the low end of the market — was not one of them. “Micromax didn’t anticipate the movement from 3G to 4G so quickly,” said Ajay Sharma, former business head at Micromax. Other Indian vendors were also impacted, he added. The troubles with sales also started to flare up tensions between founders and executives, which in turn impacted Micromax’s attempts to raise capital. According to the data available on PitchBook, the company raised a total of $98.02 million. The most recent post-money valuation is noted as $745.57 million, although that dates from 2010. Former investors include Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA), Sandstone Capital and TA Associates. The last audit report filed with the Indian regulator shows that Wagner, an affiliate of TA Associates, sold its entire remaining equity stake to Placid Holdings in January 2020 and that the company bought those shares back from Placid Holdings in March 2022. The company had been in talks to raise a whopping $1.2 billion from Alibaba. But the deal never closed reportedly due to disagreements between Micromax and Alibaba over future strategy for the business. All of this was being played out amid the ambitions of Micromax’s founders and management. The company may have gained its popularity as an Indian vendor, but it did not want to remain limited to India. The company entered Russia, South Africa and the Middle East: It hired former India sales director of Research in Motion (BlackBerry) Amit Mathur as the head of its international business and created a separate supply line to cater to the demand in the global markets. The company also tapped Australian actor Hugh Jackman as its brand ambassador. Micromax roped Australian actor Hugh Jackman as its brand ambassador.

Fly Mobiles was originally based in the U.K., but a majority stake in its India and SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) business was acquired by Indian company SAR Group in 2011. Within one year of kicking off its global operations, Micromax started creating separate supply lines dedicated to its overseas markets. This helped the company control its volume and offer different models catering to the demand for specific markets. Micromax also started generating profits from its global operations. However, Micromax’s global market presence began to decline after its business in India experienced a downturn. “The profits were not to the extent that we could sustain and move to the next level as far as the branding is concerned. We were doing it obviously, but we needed support from India,” the former executive said. With margins shrinking at the company, in February 2017, Mathur left and was not replaced. Micromax eventually sunset its global business operations. Some former executives believe that Micromax’s founders could have handled the situation better if they had given a free hand to others coming on board. That was despite the fact that the founders were working on separate businesses simultaneously. Sharma co-founded an EV startup called Revolt Motors in 2019 (sold to New Delhi–based RattanIndia Enterprises in January). Jain also has accessories-focused startup Play Design Labs, which produces wearables and audio devices. An angel investor and two-time startup founder who works closely with Micromax said the founders’ decision to run Micromax alongside other businesses suggests a lack of trust and confidence in their own venture. “I personally felt that when all your energy and fire are there with one particular brand and then every day you want it to grow, then nobody can stop it,” echoed a top-level executive who left the company earlier this year. “If you are not being able to devote that time, how will an organization survive?” The four founders are said to have different qualities that helped the company compete against global brands in India and international markets. While Jain is good at building relationships, Sharma is stronger at brand building and marketing, Arora at handling the technical side, and Agarwal at managing finance, say sources. “The good part is they [complement] each other,” a former executive who worked closely with the founders for over four years said. Micromax co-founder Rahul Sharma. Image Credits: Pradeep Gaur/Mint In 2020, Micromax attempted a comeback in smartphones in India. But instead of launching new features, it focused on stoking anti-China sentiment, in the wake of a skirmish between Indian and Chinese army soldiers in June. It ploughed $61 million into the plan with a mantra of “more R&D” to take on Chinese smartphone vendors. Micromax launched two new smartphone models in 2020 under its “In” series to mark its return in the market. To compete directly with Chinese models, both phones were priced in the sub-$150 segment. The company later expanded the lineup to five models. But the whole endeavor was a flop. And a former Micromax executive said that even if anti-China sentiment was part of the strategy, the timing was all wrong: The launch happened in early November — over four months after the skirmish. “By that time, the iron had become cold. It, in fact, had a negative impact because the Chinese vendors started saying, ‘We are more Indian than Indians,'” the executive said, referring to Xiaomi’s claim that it made 99.5% of its phones in India. Then in 2021, Micromax finally teased the launch of its first 5G smartphone. Two years on, that phone has yet to materialize. Farther afield, Micromax was also looking to partner with some carriers in the U.S. to enter North America, according to a person familiar with the plans. That, too, never happened. Instead, it continued to see revenues decline. Micromax’s total revenue dropped drastically to a mere $94.26 million in 2022, compared to $1.33 billion in 2016. Smartphone shipments fared no better, dropping to just 370,000 in 2022 from 9.65 million in 2016, according to IDC data. Micromax was not alone in its struggles to compete against Chinese vendors in India. Lava International, Karbonn Mobiles and Spice Mobility also all threw their hats into the ring. Lava, with a focus on 5G, has seen some growth in recent months, but Karbonn Mobiles and Spice Mobility, the two companies that worked with Google — alongside Micromax — to launch its first Android One program in India, have left the smartphone market.

Data shared by market analyst firm Counterpoint also shows that while Micromax saw an 80% year-on-year decline in its overall shipments in 2022, Lava’s smartphone shipments grew 85% year-on-year. The company also recently launched its midrange 5G phone called Agni 2 to take on similar options from Xiaomi and Samsung. Micromax, in contrast, has had no new models in the pipeline, according to people who worked at top positions in the company until March. While attempting a turnaround, Micromax has also cycled through a number of other executive moves in the last several months, including hiring and then losing both Luke Prakash Andrew as its chief business officer and chief product officer Sunil Loon. Co-founder Rahul Sharma, who had been the key face of the company for the last several years, resigned from his managing director’s position in April 2021. The board appointed Vikas Jain, one of the other co-founders, as the new managing director, a three-year role that would expire April 2024. Sharma stayed on as a non-executive director, per regulatory filings. Vikas Jain, co-founder of Micromax Informatics. Image Credits: Billy H.C. Kwok/Bloomberg via Getty Images People familiar with the matter said Sharma stepped down because of the botched comeback plan. “Somewhere down the line, [the founders] realized that they didn’t have any new things obviously to build up the scale or Micromax again,” a source told TechCrunch. Sharma was also behind the 2014 ill-fated launch of YU Televentures, a joint venture between now-discontinued operating system maker Cyanogen and Micromax that aimed to take on Xiaomi and its sub-brand Redmi in the country. And the company has also inevitably had wider layoffs. Earlier this year, Micromax’s executives contacted some of its employees and asked them to look for new jobs as their existing roles were no longer required. Close to 100 jobs — particularly in the sales and services teams — were reduced as a part of the cost-cutting measures, an executive who also left the company in March told TechCrunch. The company also started winding down its sales team in various states in the last few months, remaining only in a few states where it had some distributors, the executive said. The cut in the sales team has made it difficult to shift stock to retailers, which has in turn led Micromax to use the more limited, lower margin cash-and-carry channel, where retailers do not get an option to return any stock left. (Typically, vendors give retailers a time frame to return the inventory they cannot sell.) This has in turn also soured relationships between the brand and its retail channel. Micromax’s existing auditor — SR Batliboi and Associates — also resigned in June, after nearly nine years of working with the company, over not getting their demanded fee, per a recent regulatory filing. The reduction in workers and switching to a new auditor may reduce costs, but it also begs the question of how Micromax will manage its next venture. Two sources said that Micromax has started renovating one of its offices in Gurugram to kick off its work on the new project exploring the EV market, but few employees remain at Micromax to staff the business transition. But the transition has already been months in the making. In February this year, Micromax founders Jain, Rajesh Agarwal and Sumeet Kumar incorporated a company named Micromax Mobility, per regulatory filings. Although Sharma also had a small stint in the EV market with Revolt Motors, his name is not attached to the new venture’s filings. A source said that Micromax directors started discussions and prepared documentation for the mobility business earlier this year. The company did not brief most of its top-level management about the move. Jain declined an interview, and he also declined to answer a list of questions shared over email related to recent the job cuts, plans with the EV venture and future of the company in the smartphone market. TechCrunch also attempted to contact Micromax’s media relations multiple times, with no success. Micromax’s failure in the smartphone market sends a stark warning to other handset makers that want to compete on price alone. Even if it can draw a line under its own misadventures, it remains to be seen if the company can make the shift to the EV market, which is already crowded. So as Micromax moves out of the frying pan that is India’s mobile phone market, that doesn’t keep it out of the fire. Those that might pose a threat include Ola Electric, Ather Energy, and traditional automobile players such as Bajaj and Hero Electric."
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/zoom-data-mining-for-ai-terms-gdpr-eprivacy/,TechCrunch,Zoom knots itself a legal tangle over use of customer data for training AI models,"Three years ago Zoom settled with the FTC over a claim of deceptive marketing around security claims, having been accused of overstating the strength of the encryption it offered. Now the videoconferencing platform could be headed for a similar tangle in Europe in relation to its privacy small print. The recent terms & conditions controversy sequence goes like this: A clause added to Zoom’s legalese back in March 2023 grabbed attention on Monday after a post on Hacker News claimed it allowed the company to use customer data to train AI models “with no opt out”. (This Stack Diary report was first to highlight the implications of Zoom’s T&Cs changes which then got picked over in comments on Hacker News). Cue outrage on social media. Although, on closer inspection, some pundits suggested the no opt out applied only to “service generated data” (telemetry data, product usage data, diagnostics data etc), i.e. rather than everything Zoom’s customers are doing and saying on the platform. Still, people were mad. Meetings are, after all, painful enough already without the prospect of some of your “inputs” being repurposed to feed AI models that might even — in our fast-accelerating AI-generated future — end up making your job redundant. The relevant clauses from Zoom’s T&Cs are 10.2 through 10.4 (screengrabbed below). Note the bolded last line emphasizing the consent claim related to processing “audio, video or chat customer content” for AI model training — which comes after a wall of text where users entering into the contractual agreement with Zoom commit to grant it expansive rights for all other types of usage data (and other, non-AI training purposes too): Screengrab: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch Setting aside the obvious reputational risks sparked by righteous customer anger, certain privacy-related legal requirements apply to Zoom in the European Union where regional data protection laws are in force. So there are legal risks at play for Zoom, too. The relevant laws here are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies when personal data is processed and gives people a suite of rights over what’s done with their information; and the ePrivacy Directive, an older piece of pan-EU legislation which deals with privacy in electronic comms. Previously ePrivacy was focused on traditional telecoms services but the law was modified at the end of 2020, via the European Electronic Communications Code, to extend confidentiality duties to so-called over-the-top services such as Zoom. So Article 5 of the Directive — which prohibits “listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications and the related traffic data by persons other than users, without the consent of the users concerned” — looks highly relevant here. Rewinding a little, Zoom responded to the ballooning controversy over its T&Cs by pushing out an update — including the bolded consent note in the screengrab above — which it also claimed, in an accompanying blog post, “confirm[s] that we will not use audio, video, or chat customer content to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent”. Its blog post is written in the usual meandering corpspeak — peppered with claims of commitment to transparency but without Zoom clearly addressing customer concerns about its data use. Instead its crisis PR response wafts in enough self-serving side-chatter and product jargon to haze the view. The upshot is a post obtuse enough to leave a general reader still scratching their head over what’s actually going on. Which is called ‘shooting yourself in the foot’ when you’re facing a backlash trigged by apparently contradictory statements in your communications. It can also imply a company has something to hide. Zoom wasn’t any clearer when TechCrunch contacted it with questions about its data-for-AI processing in an EU law context; failing to provide us with straight answers to queries about the legal basis it’s relying on for processing to train AI models on regional users’ data; or even, initially, to confirm whether access to the generative AI features it offers, such as an automated meeting summary tool, is dependent on the user consenting to their data being used as AI training fodder. At this point its spokesperson just reiterated its line that: “Per the updated blog and clarified in the ToS — We’ve further updated the terms of service (in section 10.4) to clarify/confirm that we will not use audio, video, or chat Customer Content to train our artificial intelligence models without customer consent.” [emphasis its] Zoom’s blog post, which is attributed to chief product officer Smita Hashim, goes on to discuss some examples of how it apparently gathers “consent”: Depicting a series of menus it may show to account owners or administrators; and a pop-up it says is displayed to meeting participants when the aforementioned (AI-powered) Meeting Summary feature is enabled by an admin. In the case of the first group (admins/account holders) Hashim’s post literally states that they “provide consent”. This wording, coupled with what’s written in the next section — vis-a-vis meeting participants receiving “notice” of what the admins have enabled/agreed to — implies Zoom is treating the process of obtaining consent as something that can be delegated to an admin on behalf of a group of people. Hence the rest of the group (i.e. meeting participants) just getting “notice” of the admin’s decision to turn on AI-powered meeting summaries and give it the green light to train AIs on their inputs. However the law on consent in the EU — if, indeed, that’s the legal basis Zoom is relying upon for this processing — doesn’t work like that. The GDPR requires a per individual ask if you’re claiming consent as your legal basis to process personal data. As noted above, ePrivacy also explicitly requires that electronic comms be kept confidential unless the user consents to interception (or unless there’s some national security reason for the surveillance but Zoom training generative AI features doesn’t seem likely to qualify for that). Back to Zoom’s blog post: It refers to the pop-up shown to meeting participants as “notice” or “notification” that its generative AI services are in use, with the company offering a brief explainer that: “We inform you and your meeting participants when Zoom’s generative AI services are in use. Here’s an example [below graphic] of how we provide in-meeting notification.” Image credits: Zoom Yet in its response to the data-for-AI controversy Zoom has repeatedly claimed it does not process customer content to train its AIs without their consent. So is this pop-up just a “notification” that its AI-powered feature has been enabled or a bona fide ask where Zoom claims it obtains consent from customers to this data-sharing? Frankly its description is not at all clear. For the record, the text displayed on the notice pop-up reads* — and do note the use of the past tense in the title (which suggests data sharing is already happening): Two options are presented to meeting participants who see this notice. One is a button labelled “Got it!” (which is highlighted in bright blue so apparently pre-selected); the other is a button labelled “Leave meeting” (displayed in grey, so not the default selection). There is also a hyperlink in the embedded text where users can click to “learn more” (but, presumably, won’t be presented with additional options vis-a-vis its processing of their inputs). Fans of European Union data protection law will be familiar with the requirement that for consent to be a valid legal basis for processing people’s data it must meet a certain standard — namely: It must be clearly informed; freely given; and purpose limited (specific, not bundled). Nor can it be nudged with self-serving pre-selections. These folks might also point out that Zoom’s notice to meeting participants about its AI generated feature being activated does not provide them with a free choice to deny consent for their data to become AI training fodder. (Indeed, judging by the tense used, it’s already processing their info for that by the time they see this notice.) This much is obvious since the meeting participant must either agree to their data being used by Zoom for uses including AI training or quit the meeting altogether. There are no other choices available. And it goes without saying that telling your users the equivalent of ‘hey, you’re free to leave‘ does not sum to a free choice over what you’re doing with their data. (See, for e.g.: The CJEU’s recent ruling against Meta/Facebook’s forced consent.) Zoom is not even offering its users the ability to pay it to avoid this non-essential data-mining — which is a route some regional news publishers have taken by offering consent-to-tracking paywalls (where the choice offered to readers is either to pay for access to the journalism or agree to tracking to get free access). Although even that approach looks questionable, from a GDPR fairness point of view. And it does remain under legal challenge. But the key point here is that if consent is the legal basis claimed to process personal data in the EU there must actually be a free choice available. And a choice to be in the meeting or not in the meeting is not that. (Add to that, as a mere meeting participant — i.e. not an admin/account holder — such people are unlikely to be the most senior person in the virtual room — and withdrawing from a meeting you didn’t initiate/arrange on data ethics grounds may not feel available to that many employees. There’s likely a power imbalance between the meeting admin/organizer and the participants, just as there is between Zoom the platform providing a communications service and Zoom’s users needing to use its platform to communicate.) As if that wasn’t enough, Zoom is very obviously bundling its processing of data for providing the generative AI feature with other non-essential purposes — such as product improvement and model training. That looks like a straight-up contravention of the GDPR purpose limitation principle, which would also apply in order for consent to be valid. But all of these analyses are only relevant if Zoom is actually relying on consent as its legal basis for the processing, as its PR response to the controversy seems to claim — or, at least, it does in relation to processing customer content for training AI models. Of course we asked Zoom to confirm its legal basis for the AI training processing in the EU but the company avoided giving us a straight answer. Funny that! Pressed to justify its claim to be obtaining consent for such processing against EU law consent standards, a spokesman for the company sent us the following (irrelevant and/or misleading) bullet-points [again, emphasis its]: So Zoom’s defence of the consent it claims to offer is literally that it gives users the choice to not use its service. (It should really ask how well that kind of argument went for Meta in front of Europe’s top court.) Even the admin/account-holder consent flow Zoom does serve up is problematic. Its blog post doesn’t even explicitly describe this as a consent flow — it just couches it an example of “our UI through which a customer admin opts in to one of our new generative AI features”, linguistically bundling opting into its generative AI with consent to share data with it for AI training etc.  In the screengrab Zoom includes in the blog post (which we’ve embedded below) the generative AI Meeting Summary feature is stated in annotated text as being off by default — apparently requiring the admin/account holder to actively enable it. There is also, seemingly, an explicit choice associated with the data sharing that is presented to the admin. (Note the tiny blue check box in the second menu.) However — if consent is the claimed legal basis — another problem is that this data-sharing box is pre-checked by default, thereby requiring the admin to take the active step of unchecking it in order for data not to be shared. So, in other words, Zoom could be accused of deploying a dark pattern to try and force consent from admins. When the choice under EU law must be an active opt-in, not an opt-out. Under EU law, there is also an onus to clearly inform users of the purpose you’re asking them to consent to. But, in this case, if the meeting admin doesn’t carefully read Zoom’s small print — where it specifies the data sharing feature can be unchecked if they don’t want these inputs to be used by it for purposes such as training AI models — they might ‘agree’ by accident (i.e. by failing to uncheck the box). Especially as a busy admin might just assume they need to have this “data sharing” box checked to be able to share the meeting summary with other participants, as they will probably want to. So even the quality of the ‘choice’ Zoom is presenting to meeting admins looks problematic against EU standards for consent-based processing to fly. Add to that, Zoom’s illustration of the UI admins get to see includes a further small print qualification — where the company warns in fantastically tiny writing that “product screens subject to change”. So, er, who knows what other language and/or design it may have deployed to ensure it’s getting mostly affirmative responses to data-sharing user inputs for AI training to maximize its data harvesting. Image credits: Zoom But hold your horses! Zoom isn’t actually relying on consent as its legal basis to data-mine users for AI, according to Simon McGarr, a solicitor with Dublin-based law firm McGarr Solicitors. He suggests all the consent theatre described above is essentially a “red herring” in EU law terms — because Zoom is relying on a different legal basis for the AI data mining: Performance of a contract. “Consent is irrelevant and a red herring as it is relying on contract as the legal basis for processing,” he told TechCrunch when we asked for his views on the legal basis question and Zoom’s approach more generally. In McGarr’s analysis, Zoom is applying a US drafting to its legalese — which does not take account of Europe’s (distinct) framework for data protection. “Zoom is approaching this in terms of ownership of personal data,” he argues. “There’s non personal data and personal data but they’re not distinguishing between those two. Instead they’re distinguishing between content data (“customer content data”) and what they call telemetry data. That is metadata. Therefore they’re approaching this with a framework that isn’t compatible with EU law. And this is what has led them to make assertions in respect of ownership of data — you can’t own personal data. You can only be either the controller or the processor. Because the person continues to have rights as the data subject. “The claim that they can do what they like with metadata runs contrary to Article 4 of the GDPR which defines what is personal data — and specifically runs contrary to the decision in the Digital Rights Ireland case and a whole string of subsequent cases confirming that metadata can be, and frequently is, personal data — and sometimes sensitive personal data, because it can reveal relationships [e.g. trade union membership, legal counsel, a journalist’s sources etc].” McGarr asserts that Zoom does need consent for this type of processing to be lawful in the EU — both for metadata and customer content data used to train AI models — and that it can’t actually rely on performance of a contract for what is obviously non-essential processing. It also, therefore, needs consent to be opt in, not opt out. So, basically, no pre-checked boxes that only an admin can uncheck, and with nothing but a vague “notice” sent to other users that essentially forces them to consent after the fact or else quit the app; which is not a free and unbundled choice under EU law. “It’s a US kind of approach,” he adds of Zoom’s modus operandi. “It’s the notice approach — where you tell people things, and then you say, well, I gave them notice of X. But, you know, that isn’t how EU law works.” Add to that, processing sensitive personal data — which Zoom is likely to be doing, even vis-a-vis “service generated data” — requires an even higher bar of explicit consent. Yet — from an EU law perspective — all the company has offered so far in response to the T&Cs controversy is obfuscation and/or irrelevant excuses. Pressed for a response on legal basis, and asked directly if it’s relying on performance of a contract for the processing, a Zoom spokesman declined to provide us with an answer — saying only: “We’ve logged your questions and will let you know if we get anything else to share.” The company’s spokesman also did not respond to questions asking it to clarify how it defines customer “inputs” for the data-sharing choice that (only) admins get — so it’s still not entirely clear whether “inputs” refers exclusively to customer comms content. But that does appear to be the implication from the bolded claim in its contract not to use “audio, video or chat Customer Content to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent” (note, there’s no bolded mention of Zoom not using customer metadata for AI model training). If Zoom is excluding “service generated data” (aka metadata) from even its opt out consent it seems to believe it can help itself to these signals without applying even the legally meaningless theatre of consent it’s offering for customer content. Yet, as McGarr points out, “service generated data” doesn’t get a carve out from EU data protection law; it can and often is classed as personal data. So, actually, Zoom does need consent (i.e. the opt in, informed, specific and freely given real-deal) to process users’ metadata too. And let’s not forget ePrivacy has fewer available legal bases than the GDPR — and explicitly requires consent for interception. Hence legal experts’ conviction that Zoom can only rely on (opt in) consent as its legal basis to use people’s data for training AIs. A recent intervention by the Italian data protection authority on OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot service, ChatGPT appears to have arrived at a similar view on use of data for AI model training — since the authority stipulated that OpenAI can’t rely on performance of a contract to process personal data for that. It said the AI giant would have to choose between consent or legitimate interests for processing people’s data for training models. OpenAI later resumed service in Italy having switched to a claim of legitimate interests — which requires it to offer users a way to opt out of the processing (which it had added). For AI chatbots, the legal basis for model training question remains under investigation by EU regulators. But, in Zoom’s case, the key difference is that for comms services it’s not just GDPR but ePrivacy that applies — and the latter doesn’t allow LI to be used for tracking. Given the relative novelty of generative AI services, not to mention the huge hype around data-driven automation features, Zoom may be hoping its own data-mining for AI will fly quietly under international regulators’ radar. Or it may just be focused elsewhere. There’s no doubt the company is feeling under pressure competitively — after what had, in recent years, been surging global demand for virtual meetings falling off a cliff since we passed the peak of COVID-19 and rushed back to in-person handshakes. Add to that the rise of generative AI giants like OpenAI is clearly dialling up competition for productivity tools by massively scaling access to new layers of AI capabilities. And Zoom has only relatively recently made its own play to join the generative AI race, announcing it would dial up investment back in February — after posting its first fourth quarter net loss since 2018 (and shortly after announcing a 15% headcount reduction). There’s also already no shortage of competition for videoconferencing — with tech giants like Google and Microsoft offering their own comms tool suites with videochatting baked in. Plus even more AI-fuelled rivalry is accelerating down the pipes as startups tap into generative AI APIs to layer extra features on vanilla tools like videoconferencing — which is driving further commodification of the core platform component Zoom’s business is based on. All of which is to say Zoom is likely feeling the heat. And probably in a greater rush to train its own AI models so it can race to compete than it is to send the detail of its expanded data sharing terms for international legal review. European privacy regulators also don’t necessarily move that quickly in response to emerging techs (although Italy’s OpenAI intervention shows they can). So Zoom may feel it can take the risk. However there’s a regulatory curve ball that amps up the risk as Zoom does not appear to be main established in any EU Member State. It does have a local EMEA office in the Netherlands — but the Dutch DPA told us it is not the lead supervisory authority for Zoom. Nor does the Irish DPA appear to be (despite Zoom claiming a Dublin-based Article 27 representative). “As far as we are aware, Zoom does not have a lead supervisory authority in the European Economic Area,” a spokesman for the Dutch DPA told TechCrunch. “According to their privacy statement the controller is Zoom Video Communications, Inc, which is based in the United States. Although Zoom does have an office in the Netherlands, it seems that the office does not have decision-making authority and therefore the Dutch DPA is not lead supervisory authority.” If that’s correct, and decision-making in relation to Zoom’s EU users data takes place exclusively over the pond, any data protection authority in the region is potentially competent to interrogate its compliance with the GDPR — rather than local complaints and concerns having to be routed through a single lead authority. Which maximizes the regulatory risk Zoom is exposed to on data protection issues since any EU DPA could make an intervention if it believes user data is at risk. Add to that, ePrivacy does not contain a one-stop-shop mechanism to streamline regulatory oversight as the GDPR does — so it’s already the case that any authority could probe Zoom’s compliance with that directive. The GDPR allows for fines that can reach up to 4% of global annual turnover. While ePrivacy lets authority set appropriately dissuasive fines (which, in the French CNIL’s case, has led to several hefty multi-million dollar penalties on a number of tech giants in recent years in relation to cookie tracking infringements). So a public backlash by users angry at sweeping data-for-AI T&Cs may cause Zoom more of a headache than it thinks. *NB: The quality of the graphic on Zoom’s blog post is poor, with text appearing substantially pixellated and making it hard to pick-out the words without cross-checking them elsewhere (which we did) This report was updated to include a link to Stack Diary’s reporting about the Zoom T&Cs changes which was the source for the Hacker News post we cited. We also corrected a typo; we meant CNIL recently used ePrivacy to crack down on cookie tracking, not cooking tracking"
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/bluejeans-folds/,TechCrunch,BlueJeans folds,"Verizon dropped hundreds of millions on BlueJeans at the height of the pandemic lockdowns. Three years and some change later, the lesser-known video-conferencing app is done for, the telecom giant told users today. In a mass email, Verizon wrote that it “made the difficult decision to sunset our suite of BlueJeans products.” 9to5Google first reported the news. (Verizon is TechCrunch’s former parent company.) Verizon added that it chose to kill the B2B app “due to the changing market landscape.” That changing landscape has everything to do with Zoom, which dominated the COVID-19 video-conferencing boom and lives on as a prominent service for businesses, alongside competitors such as Google Hangouts. Yet, even Zoom isn’t trading anywhere near its October 2020 peak.  BlueJeans was founded in 2011 by former chief technology officer Alagu Periyannan and former CEO and head of product Krish Ramakrishnan. Within two years of the Verizon deal going through, both co-founders left — as did Ramakrishnan’s successor, former CEO Quentin Gallivan, along with former CFO Robert Park. The first BlueJeans features to go, as of August 31, will be its basic and free trial tiers. A member of BlueJeans’ support staff told TechCrunch by phone that the service will continue to operate normally for other users until at least December 2023. For now, the BlueJeans website still reads, “Nothing fits better than BlueJeans. Meet for as long as you want. Forever.”"
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/endowus-35million/,TechCrunch,Singapore wealth management platform Endowus raises $35M,"Back in 2021 and early 2022, there was a flurry of VC interest in Southeast Asian investment apps. One of them was Singapore-based Endowus, which raised two rounds in rapid succession: a Series A in June 2021 followed just seven months later by $25.6 million in follow-on funding. Now two years later, despite a much different funding environment, especially for fintech startups, Endowus is announcing another round. This time it’s $35 million with new investors, including Citi Ventures and MUFG Innovation Partners, bringing the company’s total raised so far to $95 million. Participants also include “four of Asia’s wealthiest families,” the startup said in its press release, whose operating businesses encompass banking and real estate across Southeast Asia and China. Returning investors include notable firms like UBS Next, Singapore’s EDBI, Prosus Ventures (owned by Naspers), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Singtel Innov8 and Endowus employees. The new funding will be used to scale in its main markets of Singapore and Hong Kong, where it currently serves over 100K clients in both markets. As a group, Endowus now has over $5 billion in assets under management and $40 million in savings for its clients. Despite macroeconomic challenges, Endowus said it saw organic revenue growth of 80% in 2022 and tripled its group revenue after completing the acquisition of multi-family office Carret Private. Since TechCrunch last covered Endowus, it has launched more services like low cost passive index funds in Singapore and Endowus Private Wealth for high-net-worth individuals. It also started services in Hong Kong this year as what it describes as the “only independent, commission-free and conflict-free digital wealth advisor and low cost fund platform.” Co-founder and chairman Samuel Rhee told TechCrunch that Endowus is now “multiple times the size of the next player and now competing with large banks and incumbent players.” Other investment apps in Singapore include Syfe and Stashaway, which also attracted big VC bucks a couple years ago. One of the main ways Endowus differentiates is being what it says is the only digital wealth platform that serves both private wealth and public pension as the first digital advisor for Singapore’s Central Provident Fund Investment Scheme (CPF). Endowus manages more than SGD $1 billion of pension assets on its platform. Rhee said one of the reasons Endowus covers pension funds as well as personal wealth is to serve clients at all stages of their financial lives, including retirement. For CPF, it built in-house a tech stack that creates a fully-automated digital process for investors. Endowus plans to replicate its CPF work with Hong Kong’s Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF). Instead of being a robo-advisor, Rhee said Endowus uses fund managers with proven track records to make top-performing, institutional-share class funds for retail investors more accessible. Endowus monetizes only through advisory fees, and Rhee says it is the first and largest platform in Singapore and Hong Kong to provide a 100% rebate of all trailer commission fees, paid through cashbacks. When asked if there is a possibility of consolidation among investment app players, Rhee said “the opportunity for wealthtech players continues to be outsized,” pointing to a McKinsey report that shows the Asia-Pacific region now accounts for at least 40%, or $218 trillion, of total global wealth. But he added that “we do anticipate increased consolidation in future as wealthtechs in Singapore and in Asia mature, and those that lack scale or technological innovation or a moat around the business will suffer, as we have seen in the recent downturn. We may see some players exit the market, and smaller players closing down.” As for how Endowus fared during the slowdown in fintech funding (and funding in general), Rhee said the company had no problems securing fundraising from its investors. “We are also fortunate to have some of the biggest investors as our shareholders,” he added, like Citi Ventures, MUFG Innovation Partners and UBS."
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/wework-goes-from-a-47b-valuation-to-subtantial-doubts-about-its-ability-to-continue-as-a-going-concern/,TechCrunch,WeWork goes from $47B valuation to ‘substantial doubts’ about its future,"WeWork is struggling to survive in a post-pandemic world. In announcing its earnings today, the flexible space provider said that “substantial doubt exists about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.” WeWork has faced a number of challenges for years now, and with so many companies abandoning office space and more people being able to work remotely, demand for its co-working spaces has steadily declined over time. Today, the 13-year-old company announced a net loss of $397 million for the second quarter on revenue of $877 million. While revenue was up 4% year-over-year, WeWork interim CEO David Tolley noted in a statement: “Excess supply in commercial real estate, increasing competition in flexible space and macroeconomic volatility drove higher member churn and softer demand than we anticipated, resulting in a slight decline in memberships.” As such, WeWork went on to say its ability to continue operating is contingent upon “successful execution of management’s plan to improve liquidity and profitability over the next 12 months.” Those efforts include cutting rent and tenancy costs via restructuring actions and negotiation of more favorable lease terms; increasing revenue by reducing member churn and increasing new sales; controlling expenses and limiting capital expenditures; and seeking additional capital via issuance of debt or equity securities or asset sales. WeWork’s stock was down 33% after hours to 13 cents, after closing at 21 cents. By Wednesday morning, it was trading at 14 cents, with a market cap of $300 million. At its prime, WeWork was valued at a staggering $47 billion after raising $1 billion in its SoftBank-led Series H round in January 2019. Co-founder and then-CEO Adam Neumann notoriously stepped down later that year amid allegations of a toxic combination of arrogance and poor management. WeWork has since been very publicly trying to redeem itself and turn around investor — and public — perception. TechCrunch reported on some of those efforts to reinvent itself before it went public in October of 2021, but clearly those efforts haven’t panned out as hoped.

2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/lyft-wants-to-kill-surge-pricing/,TechCrunch,Lyft wants to kill surge pricing,"Lyft has been cutting fares in order to secure more riders, and it’s working. But that success has come with a (literal) cost. The ride-hail company reported Tuesday during its second quarter 2023 earnings an increase in riders and decrease in revenue per active rider. That discrepancy was fueled by a decision by the company to “price in line with the market,” according to CEO David Risher. Lyft’s revenue per rider decreased almost 5% quarter-over-quarter, while the number of active riders increased in the second quarter to 21,487 riders, up from 19,552 in the first quarter. Lyft appears to be not only trying to keep prices competitive with Uber, it’s also working to kill off surge pricing, or “primetime” as the company calls it. During Tuesday’s earnings call, Risher said that surge pricing might work to incentivize more drivers during peak service, but it also acts as a demand suppressor when riders don’t want to pay exorbitant fees just to get home after work. “[Primetime pricing] is a bad form of price raising,” said Risher. “It’s particularly bad because riders hate it with a fiery passion. And so we’re really trying to get rid of it, and because we’ve got such a good driver supply…it’s decreased significantly.” Lyft’s driver supply is the highest its been in three years (up more than 20% year-over-year) and the average hours per active driver has reached a new high above 2019 levels, according to a spokesperson for Lyft. Risher noted that this has helped the share of rides affected by surge pricing drop down 35% from the first quarter. “That has a revenue implication — we’re actually taking less money,” said the executive. “But it’s good for our riders, and it’s good for our overall market results.” At least in the short term, ditching surge pricing might serve as a differentiator for Lyft as it continues to compete with its so-called “big brother” Uber."
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/human-toddlers-are-inspiring-new-approaches-to-robot-learning/,TechCrunch,Human toddlers are inspiring new approaches to robot learning,"It’s an exciting time for robotic learning. Organizations have spent decades building complex datasets and pioneering different ways to teach systems to perform new tasks. It seems we’re on the cusp of some real breakthroughs when it comes to deploying technology that can adapt and learn on the fly. The past year, we’ve seen a large number of fascinating studies. Take VRB (Vision-Robotics Bridge), which Carnegie Mellon University showcased back in June. The system is capable of applying learnings from YouTube videos to different environments, so a programmer doesn’t have to account for every possible variation. Last month, Google’s DeepMind robotics team showed off its own impressive work, in the form of RT-2 (Robotic Transformer 2). The system is able to abstract away minutia of performing a task. In the example given, telling a robot to throw away a piece of trash doesn’t require a programmer to teach the robot to identify specific pieces of trash, pick it up and throw it away in order to perform a seemingly simple (for humans, at least) task. Want the top robotics news in your inbox each week? Sign up for Actuator here. Additional research highlighted by CMU this week compares its work to early-stage human learning. Specifically, the robotic AI agent is compared to a three-year-old toddler. Putting context, the level of learning is broken up into two categories — active and passive learning. Passive learning in this instance is teaching a system to perform a task by showing it videos or training it on the aforementioned datasets. Active learning is exactly what it sounds like — going out and performing a task and adjusting until you get it right. RoboAgent, which is a joint effort between CMU and Meta AI (yes, that Meta), combines these two types of learning, much as a human would. Here that means observing tasks being performed via the internet, coupled with active learning by way of remotely teleoperating the robot. According to the team, the system is able to take learnings from one environment and apply them to another, similar to the VRB system mentioned above.  “An agent capable of this sort of learning moves us closer to a general robot that can complete a variety of tasks in diverse unseen settings and continually evolve as it gathers more experiences,” Shubham Tulsiani of CMU’s Robotics Institute says. “RoboAgent can quickly train a robot using limited in-domain data while relying primarily on abundantly available free data from the internet to learn a variety of tasks. This could make robots more useful in unstructured settings like homes, hospitals and other public spaces.” One of the cooler bits of all of this is the fact that the dataset is open source and universally accessible. It’s also designed to be used with readily available, off-the-shelf robotics hardware, meaning researchers and companies alike can both utilize and build out a growing trove of robot data and skills. “RoboAgents are capable of much richer complexity of skills than what others have achieved,” says the Robotics Institute’s Abhinav Gupta. “We’ve shown a greater diversity of skills than anything ever achieved by a single real-world robotic agent with efficiency and a scale of generalization to unseen scenarios that is unique.” Image Credits: CMU This is all super promising stuff when it comes to building and deploying multipurpose robotics systems with an eye toward eventual general-purpose robots. The goal is to create technology that can move beyond the repetitive machines in highly structured environments that we tend to think of when we think of industrial robots. Actual real-world use and scaling is, of course, a lot easier said than done. We are much closer to the beginning when it comes to these approaches to robotic learning, but we’re moving through an exciting period for emerging multipurpose systems."
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/lyft-shares-pop-then-plop-as-it-predicts-slow-and-steady-growth/,TechCrunch,"Lyft shares pop, then plop, as it predicts slow and steady growth","Lyft made less money per active rider in the second quarter — something that might normally give investors pause. Yet, the ride-hailing giant’s stock price initially rocketed nearly 14% in after-hours trading following its Q2 2023 earnings report. The stock then shed its after-hours gains shortly before this story went live. The company’s enthusiastic investors seemed to be reacting to its positive outlook for its third fiscal quarter. While Lyft’s Q2 revenue matched Wall Street estimates of $1.02 billion — a mere 2% increase from the $1 billion in revenue Lyft pulled in Q1 — the company forecasted a gain of 11% to 13%, or $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, in Q3. According to Yahoo Finance data, analysts only expected Lyft to reach $1.09 billion next quarter. Lyft’s revenue per rider decreased almost 5% quarter-over-quarter, a result of the ride-hailing giant’s attempt to keep fares low to compete with Uber. The upshot? Lyft saw its number of active riders increase in the second quarter to 21.5 million riders, up from 19.6 million in the first quarter. But as TechCrunch noted in Q1, the question still remains as to whether this price cutting will drive enough ride volume gains to allow Lyft to return to substantial growth. Cost-cutting is Lyft’s friend now, as well as in the future. It’s possible that Lyft’s ability to trim the fat in the second quarter, something Lyft’s new CEO David Risher promised would happen when he took over in April, also initially motivated investors. In Q2 2023, Lyft’s net loss was $114 million, down from the $377.2 million it recorded a year ago and the $187.6 million it saw in Q1 2023. The company’s recent cost cutting reportedly included laying off 1,200 workers in the second quarter. Lyft plans to reduce its overall cost footprint in 2023 by about $330 million annually. The firm also aims to change how it compensates employees, reducing share-based compensation in 2023 to $550 million, down from $750 million in 2022. In 2024, that’ll drop to $350 million. Those reductions could help combat dilution at the company. On an adjusted basis, Lyft pulled in $41 million. That’s up from $22.7 million in Q1 2023, but still down from the adjusted EBITDA for Q2 2022 of $79.1 million. That said, Lyft beat its own estimates of $20 million to $30 million. Lyft closed the quarter with $638.4 million in cash and cash equivalents — an improvement from Q1’s $509.6 million. In Q3, Lyft aims to meet an adjusted EBITDA of between $75 million and $85 million."
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/so-your-startups-runway-is-dwindling-and-fundraising-is-hard-whats-next/,TechCrunch,So your startup’s runway is dwindling and fundraising is hard. What’s next?,"The concept of having a runway has its own set of maxims for startup founders. Investors we’ve interviewed generally agree that a successful fundraise should leave a startup with 18 to 36 months of capital, and by the time a startup has around 9 to 12 months of cash, it should start raising its next round. But what should startup founders do when they see the end of their runway fast approaching, investors disappearing into the woodwork, and ever fewer ways to get more capital? Historically, the most cited and repeated piece of advice has involved cutting costs, first and foremost. But norms are for normal times. The economy hasn’t been this volatile for years together, and founders today have to almost run the table: strategically cut costs where it’ll hurt the least, manage headcounts to keep growing, keep a close pulse on how growth is shaping up and tune burn rates accordingly, and more. Still, adages persist for a reason, and several investors agreed that cutting costs is still the best way to get more mileage out of your startup’s bank balance if a fundraise isn’t on the horizon.

			Unfortunately, a lot of startups will be dead. That’s just the nature of the fundraising environment right now.							Qiao Wang, core contributor, Alliance DAO


 “The minute a startup foresees some material slowdown in revenue or client decline, they should cut back costs, no matter what,” said Christian Narvaez, founder of Rayo Capital. “That would be the first step, and would help to extend your runway and give you time to fundraise. Secondly, if you’re running out of capital, think about what is happening.” Kelly Brewster, CEO of bitcoin-focused accelerator Wolf, stressed the importance of acknowledging your circumstances, especially if they are dire. “There’s only a few levers you can pull. If you are down to just two to three months, you’re out of options. You should pay employees severance, [your remaining] tax bill, and shut down the company. Or, you may find yourself in a bad situation.” Regardless of the outcome, if you have less than 9 months of runway, “you have to cut burn rate and let good people go, unfortunately,” said Qiao Wang, a core contributor at Alliance DAO. The vast majority of startups’ expenses are human resources, or salaries, and reducing them is the best way to cut expenses and extend your runway, Wang told me. “Most startups just don’t need that many people. Most founders love hiring people before they have product-market fit. If they let a few people go, it wouldn’t reduce their likelihood of success,” he said. Wang’s words ring true. These past few years are testament to the fact that companies often overhire, especially when hype, FOMO and optimism drive decisions instead of a measured consideration of what the business actually needs. The best way to consider what’s necessary to spend comes from not scaling prematurely, according to a portfolio manager who handles more than 300 web3 portfolios. “If the product isn’t fitting [its market], don’t scale your business development team just yet. And the reverse is true: If you overscale early on, it’s better to reconsider. Do you really need a 30-person team or can you deal with less? The balance is around talent,” they said, requesting anonymity. "
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/rivian-beats-on-q2-revenue-raises-ev-production-guidance-for-2023/,TechCrunch,"Rivian beats on Q2 revenue, raises EV production guidance for 2023","Rivian gained positive momentum in the second-quarter and beat Wall Street expectations as the company ramped up EV sales, narrowed losses, reduced costs and shored up its supply chain. The company struck a confident tone in its second-quarter earnings, which was released after markets closed Tuesday, even raising its production guidance for the year from 50,000 to 52,000 vehicles. The company said it expects its adjusted earnings guidance for the year to improve to a loss of $4.2 billion, which while still a massive number is better than it expected. Rivian reported revenue of $1.12 billion in the second quarter, a more than threefold increase from the same period last year. That revenue jump was largely driven by the delivery (or sale) of 12,640 vehicles. About $34 million of that revenue came from the sale of zero-emission regulatory credits, according to the company’s regulatory filing. Rivian is still very much operating at a loss, although even that showed improvement. Rivian reported a net loss of $1.19 billion compared to a $1.7 billion loss in Q2 2022. On an adjusted basis, Rivian reported a loss of $881 million, or $1.08 per share. Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue of $1 billion and an adjusted earning per share loss of $1.36. “Our second quarter results reflect our continued focus on cost efficiency as we accelerate the drive towards profitability,” founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. “On a quarter-over-quarter basis, delivered vehicles grew around 60% while gross profit per vehicle improved by about $35,000.  We have achieved meaningful reductions in both R1 and EDV vehicle unit cost across the key components, including material costs, overhead and logistics. It was a strong quarter, and we remain focused on ramping production, driving cost efficiencies, developing future technologies, and enhancing the customer experience.” The takeaway here is a company that seems to have resolved some of its biggest money-sucking problems, including less-than-ideal contracts with some suppliers. Rivian said in its letter to shareholders that it negotiated supplier price reductions, including the elimination of short-term premiums. Rivian also lowered costs through layoffs in 2022 and 2023 that reduced payroll and other expenses. For instance, Rivian spent $444 million on research and development in the second quarter, about 18% less than the same period last year. The company said the decrease was primarily due to a $94 million reduction in payroll and related expenses, including stock-based compensation. Capital expenditures also dropped to $255 million compared to $359 million in the same year-ago period. Rivian said cap expenditures were higher last year because it spent more on equipment and construction in the early stages of its production. Rivian said it ended the second quarter with $10.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments."
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/kenyan-logistics-startup-sendy-shuts-down-embarks-on-asset-sale/,TechCrunch,"Kenyan logistics startup Sendy shuts down, embarks on asset sale","Sendy, a Kenyan logistics startup that enabled retailers to purchase FMCGs directly from manufacturers, among other services, is shutting down its operations and exploring a sale of its assets, TechCrunch has learned. Meshack Alloys, Sendy co-founder, confirmed the sale to TechCrunch without offering more details, saying: “We are in the middle of an acquisition process. So yes, Sendy is being acquired. We will issue a formal joint statement in two weeks or so time. In the meantime, we are unable to comment on further details at this time.” According to several sources, the company ran out of funds two months ago and had been scrambling to cut costs for the past year to remain afloat. Last July, it announced a 10% cut of its workforce, which Alloys noted was in response to the “current realities impacting tech companies globally.” Since then, however, Sendy’s workforce has been pruned further in more cost-cutting measures (shuttering a product line and exiting a market). Last October, the Kenyan startup laid off 54 employees and wound down its supply service — and this February, it exited its end-to-end fulfillment offering in Nigeria, a market it entered two years ago. Sendy’s struggles marked the latest setback for a crop of B2B e-commerce companies that enjoyed a fine run, raising millions of dollars and ballooning in value, but have since run into operational costs and marginal customer pricing problems. The startup had targeted to raise $100 million last year but only got a fraction of the funding from MOL PLUS, the corporate venture capital of Japanese transport company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. Since the deal, Sendy has been exploring other options to shore up its business these past few months, including seeking fresh capital and a buyer, three people familiar with the matter said. But that hasn’t come easy. The Kenyan startup, valued at over $80 million late last year, was in talks with several investors to raise additional capital a few months back but at a lower valuation of $40 million to $60 million. However, one of its key investors backed out of the transaction, leaving Sendy short on funds for the last two to three months, including funds to cover salaries — it is now attempting to sell some of its assets, the people said. Furthermore, the pool of potential buyers is small. According to people familiar with the company’s dealings, Sendy is in talks with other African companies in the B2B e-commerce and trucking space, including Trella, Sabi, Wasoko, and one of its investors, to sell some of its assets, including tech and fulfillment operations. It’s unclear if any of the talks have resulted in a deal, and discussions on various options could still be ongoing, including an acquisition, as claimed by the startup. Over 200 employees are set to be affected by the closure. Sendy was co-founded in 2015 by Alloys, Evanson Biwott, Don Okoth and Malaika Judd. It has raised $26.5 million in disclosed funding from several investors, including Toyota Tsusho, Atlantica Ventures, VestedWorld, Keppel Capital, Enza Capital, AAICA Investment Pte Ltd, Sunu Capital and Goodwill Investments."
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/youtube-update-homepage-watch-history/,TechCrunch,YouTube no longer suggests videos if your ‘watch history’ is turned off,"YouTube announced Tuesday that its newest update disables all its video recommendations for users who have their watch history turned off, solving an arguably annoying problem for those who may not want to be bothered by a sea of suggested videos. YouTube viewers are used to having a home feed full of thumbnails since the video-sharing platform shows recommendations based on watch history settings. However, thanks to the latest update, users can turn off their watch history and experience a simpler homepage that feels less cluttered and chaotic. Instead, there will just be the search bar and the left-hand guide menu with shortcuts to Subscriptions, Shorts and Library. “We are launching this new experience to make it more clear which YouTube features rely on watch history to provide video recommendations and make it more streamlined for those of you who prefer to search rather than browse recommendations,” Google writes in today’s post. The company added that users will see these changes over the next few months. In other YouTube news, some iOS users are currently complaining about buffering issues while watching live content on YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime Channels. Earlier today, YouTube confirmed the issue and said it was working on a solution. A few hours later, there has yet to be an update on whether this was fixed. Those affected by the buffering reported that content keeps freezing on their iOS devices (both iPhone and iPad). It appears that this isn’t an issue when viewers watch the same content on Android devices, TVs and other devices."

The first Elytra will fly on a Firefly Alpha rocket in 2024, part of a rapid-response mission contract with Texas-based startup Xtenti for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). The Elytra vehicles had previously been called “space utility vehicles.” Originally, Firefly said it would develop two SUVs, a smaller SUV Light and a considerably larger and more capable SUV Lux. Now, the company says it will offer three vehicles – Elytra Dawn, Elytra Dusk, and Elytra Dark – that will be compatible with Firefly’s Alpha small-launch vehicle and a medium-lift launch vehicle that’s still under development. “Elytra further expands Firefly’s on-orbit services by opening access to more orbits, extending the life of each mission, and providing deorbiting services to help minimize space debris,” Firefly CEO Bill Weber said in a statement. “Our robust vehicle line gives us a unique advantage to quickly launch, deploy, and service satellites on-orbit in response to dynamic changes in space.” Elytra Dawn is optimized for low Earth orbit (LEO) missions; Elytra Dusk can operate from LEO to geosynchronous (GEO) orbit; while Elytra Dark is the most rugged of the line-up, designed “to serve as persistent orbital infrastructure” and to support transfers to deep space. The first Elytra will launch next year as part of an agreement with space logistics company Xtenti, who will use its small satellite dispenser with the orbital vehicle. That mission, which will launch next year, is part of a contract with the NRO to demonstrate the dispenser’s rapid response capabilities on-orbit. After launching on Alpha, Elytra will use the “Flight Agnostic Non-interfering, Tunable Mass Rideshare Dispenser Equipment” (Fantm-Ride) dispenser to deploy commercial payloads in sun synchronous orbit; then, the vehicle will perform an on-orbit maneuver and wait, essentially, until the NRO tells it to deploy its government payloads. Defense agencies have issued a handful of contracts for “rapid response” space capabilities, like the ability to launch a rocket in short notice or deploy satellites in-orbit at the drop of a hat. While this mission with Xtenti is designed to show the latter, Firefly is also looking to demonstrate the former: Last year, the company won a contract with the U.S. Space Force to use Alpha to launch a satellite into orbit with just 24 hours notice."
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/google-messages-will-now-use-rcs-by-default-and-encrypt-group-chats/,TechCrunch,Google’s Messages app will now use RCS by default and encrypt group chats,"Google announced today it’s making its Messages by Google app more secure with improvements to RCS, or Rich Communication Services — a protocol aimed at replacing SMS that is more on par with the advanced features found in Apple’s iMessage. The company says it will now make RCS the default for both new and existing Messages app users. In addition, end-to-end encryption for group chats is now fully rolled out to all RCS users. The latter had launched into an open beta this year after earlier tests but was not fully launched until now. With this update, all conversations between users in Messages, whether 1:1 or group chats, will now be kept private, Google says. Since rolling out RCS to U.S. Android users in 2019, Google has been campaigning in an effort to pressure Apple into adopting the technology in its own messaging service, iMessage. It even launched a website last year to explain why RCS benefits consumers, noting “It’s not about the color of the bubbles. It’s the blurry videos, broken group chats, missing read receipts and typing indicators, no texting over Wi-Fi and more.” Google then went on to accuse Apple of refusing to adopt modern texting standards, to the detriment of its own customers’ experience, hoping to bring consumers into its fight. However, Apple isn’t just falling behind in adopting modern tech as Google claims. It knows that iMessage is one of the biggest sources for ecosystem lock-in. The green bubbles are undesirable to Apple users, particularly young people. Plus, as the company has expressed in court filings, it has no interest in making a version of iMessage for Android, as it believed it would hurt the company more than it helped it. Apple CEO Tim Cook was even once asked at a conference if Apple would adopt RCS so the user’s mother could better see the videos he sent her. To that, he replied, “Buy your mom an iPhone.” Regardless, Google’s efforts in moving forward with RCS continue. The feature will now be enabled as the default for all users, Google says, unless they had previously turned off RCS in their Settings. Users will continue to be able to opt-out by switching RCS off in Settings after today’s rollout as well, a help document indicates. With RCS enabled, users are able to take advantage of more advanced messaging features, like sharing high-res photos and videos; see typing indicators; get read receipts; send messages over mobile data and Wi-Fi; rename, edit and remove themselves from group chats; and use end-to-end encryption — a host of features iMessage users have had for years."

However, the category’s meteoric rise preceded an even more meteoric fall over the last 18 to 24 months. From 2018 to 2021, investments in the AV sector across the U.S. and Europe increased by nearly 2.5x, eventually peaking at close to $10 billion in 2021. Then, in 2022, investments fell to $4 billion, with 2023 likely to see further precipitous declines. Meanwhile, the broader robotics ecosystem has continued to flourish, with companies focused on mostly industrial “vertical” use cases now commanding the bulk of investment dollars. In 2022, these companies attracted $7 billion in investments, defying the broader slowdown in VC investment by growing 15% over the previous year. We recently analyzed the trends shaping the industry in our State of Robotics report, and identified five lessons that the next generation of robotics founders can take from the successes and failures of the AV industry. F-Prime State of Robotics Report. Image Credits: F-Prime Capital In the U.S. and Europe, more than $60 billion have been invested in robotics and AV alone over five years, with the AV sector leading the way. AI is making hardware much smarter, which is enabling companies to generate the kind of high-margin recurring revenues typically associated with software businesses. AI also creates opportunities to disrupt traditional industries with massive addressable markets. For example, across the logistics ecosystem, AV companies such as Aurora are disrupting the trucking industry, while companies like Locus and RightHand Robotics (an F-Prime portfolio company) are transforming how fulfillment operations are done. For founders, this surge in interest means there are more robotics investors than ever, ranging from newcomers in the category to those with an extensive track record in the space. Even top-tier investors such as Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz are starting to make investments in the category, an encouraging bellwether for overall VC interest in robotics. Nevertheless, hardware-oriented investments are not the right fit for all investors, and it’s best to seek out those who have made a commitment to robotics and understand what it takes to be successful."
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/nvidia-ceo-we-bet-the-farm-on-ai-and-no-one-knew-it/,TechCrunch,Nvidia CEO: We bet the farm on AI and no one knew it,"Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said today that the company made an existential business decision in 2018 that few realized would redefine its future and help redefine an evolving industry. It’s paid off enormously, of course, but Huang said this is only the beginning of an AI-powered near future — a future powered primarily by Nvidia hardware. Was this successful gambit lucky or smart? The answer, it seems, is “yes.” He made these remarks and reflections during a keynote at SIGGRAPH in Los Angeles. That watershed moment five years ago, Huang said, was the choice to embrace AI-powered image processing in the form of ray tracing and intelligent upscaling: RTX and DLSS, respectively. (Quotes are from my notes and may not be verbatim, some minor corrections may take place after checking the transcript.) “We realized rasterization was reaching its limits,” he said, referring to the traditional, widely used method of rendering a 3D scene. “2018 was a ‘bet the company’ moment. It required that we reinvent the hardware, the software, the algorithms. And while we were reinventing CG with AI, we were reinventing the GPU for AI.” While ray-tracing and DLSS are still in the process of being adopted across the diverse and complex world of consumer GPUs and gaming, the architecture that they had created to enable it was found to be a perfect partner for the growing machine learning development community. The massive amount of calculation required to train larger and larger generative models was served best not by traditional datacenters with some GPU capability, but systems like the H100 designed from the start to perform the necessary operations at scale. It would be fair to say that AI development was in some ways only limited by the availability of these computing resources. Nvidia was in possession of a Beanie Baby-scale boom and has sold about as many servers and workstations as it has been able to make. But Huang asserted that this has just been the beginning. The new models not only need to be trained, but run in real time by millions, perhaps billions of users on a regular basis. “The future is an LLM at the front of just about everything: “Human” is the new programming language,” he said. Everything from visual effects to a rapidly digitizing manufacturing market, factory design, and heavy industry will adopt in some degree a natural language interface, Huang hazarded. “Entire factories will be software-defined and robotic, and the cars they’ll be building will themselves be robotic. So it’s robotically designed robots building robots,” he said. Some may not share his outlook, which while plausible also happens to be extremely friendly to Nvidia’s interests. But while the degree of reliance on LLMs may be unknown, few would say it will not be adopted at all, and even a conservative estimate of who will use it and for what will necessitate a serious investment in new computing resources. Investing millions of dollars in last-generation computing resources, like CPU-focused racks, is foolish when something like a GH200, the newly revealed and datacenter-dedicated AI development hardware, can do the same job for less than a tenth of the cost and power requirements. He gleefully presented a video showing a LEGO-like assembly of multiple Grace Hopper computing units into a blade, then a rack, then a row of GH200s all connected at such high speeds that they amounted to “the world’s largest single GPU,” comprising one full exaflop of ML-specialty computing power.

If I could ask you to remember one thing from my talk today, that would be it,” he said, earning a laugh from the game audience here at SIGGRAPH. No mention of AI’s many challenges, regulation, or the entire concept of AI shifting — as it already has multiple times in the last year. It’s a rose-tinted view of the world, to be sure, but when you’re selling pickaxes and shovels during a gold rush, you can afford to think that way."
2023-08-08,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/cruise-inches-into-waymos-territory-in-the-phoenix-area/,TechCrunch,Cruise inches into Waymo’s territory in the Phoenix area,"Cruise, the self-driving subsidiary of General Motors, has expanded its robotaxi radius in the Phoenix area by 20x as it seeks to compete with Alphabet-owned Waymo in its home court. Cruise soft-launched its robotaxi service in Chandler, a city southeast of Phoenix, in December 2022. The expanded arena will now include Tempe and Scottsdale, according to a map of the region shared by CEO Kyle Vogt on Twitter. The service is free for now and will be available from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. Vogt said the expansion will hit “power users” first, then roll out to everyone else. Power users are members of the public who provide regular feedback to Cruise. In San Francisco at least, power users have access to an expanded service area at night and can use the robotaxis during the day. The company would not share how many vehicles it would add to its fleet. Cruise will have to contend with Waymo in the Phoenix area. Waymo, which has been operating a paid, driverless robotaxi service in Chandler 24/7 since 2020, recently doubled its service area in the downtown area and opened up driverless rides to the airport to members of the public. While the race has been a tight one between the two companies, Cruise has touted its ability to rapidly expand its geofenced boundaries as it “deploy[s] new foundational AV capabilities,” according to Vogt. A spokesperson clarified that Vogt is referring to the AV’s ability to generalize behaviors and circumstances in new markets so that Cruise isn’t starting from scratch in every new city it enters. “The AV is learning from the more than 3 million driverless miles the fleet has driven and continuously learns and improves with each mile,” Elizabeth Craig Conway, a Cruise spokesperson, told TechCrunch. Cruise’s expansion in Phoenix is just one of a slew of announcements from the AV company in recent weeks. On Monday, Cruise said it has begun testing its self-driving cars in Atlanta. In July, Cruise also announced the start of initial robotaxi testing in Miami, as well as plans to launch a service in Nashville. Cruise’s growth also comes as the company, along with Waymo, awaits a decision this week from California’s Public Utilities Commission on whether it will be granted a permit extension that would see it operating a commercial, driverless robotaxi service throughout San Francisco 24/7."

2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/seoul-based-proptech-dongnae-acquires-co-living-platform-dears/,TechCrunch,Seoul-based proptech Dongnae acquires co-living platform Dears,"Proptech startup Dongnae said Tuesday it plans to acquire Stevens, a South Korean company that operates co-living business Dears. The two companies did not disclose the acquisition price, but Dongnae said it will purchase Stevens with a mix of cash and equity. The Seoul-based proptech outfit previously raised a total of $34 million, including a $21 million Series A round it announced last year. Dongnae expects to close the transaction by the end of September. The company’s investors include the likes of NFX, Daol Investment, Hana Financial, MetaProp, Maple VC and WeWork co-founder Miguel McKelvey. Dongnae’s primary product, Dongnae FLEX, offers a furnished apartment rental on its platform with flexible lease terms for as short a period as four weeks and lower rental deposits. The addition of Dears will allow the company to upgrade the Dongnae FLEX service, manage properties “with a collective AUM of over $400 million,” and span 90 apartment complexes across Seoul and Pangyo, where a host of tech firms, including Kakao and Naver, are located. Dears Pangyo has more than 520 studio flat units in Pangyo. The outfit also will co-manage the Dears Myeongdong building in Seoul alongside Xi S&D. Dongnae will manage commercial spaces of Dears Myeongdong, consisting of B1, 14F and the rooftop, co-founder and CEO Matthew Shampine said, adding that Xi S&D will operate Dears Myungdong’s 112 units that offer both short- and long-term stays. Dongnae says this is its first acquisition. The current leadership team at Stevens will join Dongnae to support expansion and continue to build on their progress to date, Shampine told TechCrunch. “We are in active discussions with a number of landlords and land developers to open more buildings to be operated as and through Dongnae,” Shampine said. Former WeWork executives Shampine and Insong Kim co-founded Dongnae in 2020 to digitize South Korea’s fragmented real estate market. In South Korea, people have to work with dozens of brokers to find a new home, and there are two options to pay rent in the country: paying a monthly fee (just like in many parts of the world) and paying everything in advance, called Jeonse. “Since our Series A in March of 2022, we have been focused on growing our real estate portfolio, getting customer feedback, and building the necessary front- and back-end technology to truly create a better way to rent homes in Korea,” Shampine said. The company has invested “heavily” in enhancing the customer experience since last year. The outfit says it has digitized the entire procedure instead of the typical long, paper-filed leasing process and launched its own digital real estate consultant Suzie by integrating artificial intelligence into its platform. Like a chatbot, Suzie answers prospective residents’ questions about housing or Dongnae’s units in any spoken language. “From Adam Neumann’s Flow and companies such as Mint House, Zeus Living, and Blueground in America to Asian and European startups like Cove and Habyt — there has been great innovation in the residential rental market around the world over the past few years,” Shampine said in a statement. “Our team is committed to bringing about a better way to rent here in Korea.” Dongnae’s application is now available for download on Android and iOS."

2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/chinas-draft-measures-demand-individual-consent-for-facial-recognition-use/,TechCrunch,China’s draft measures demand ‘individual consent’ for facial recognition use,"The pervasive use of facial recognition technology across all facets of life in China has elicited both praise for its convenience and backlash around privacy concerns. The widespread adoption has also fueled the exponential growth of valuations in companies specializing in the field, such as AI giants SenseTime and Megvii. Now the industry is facing some potentially significant changes as Beijing steps up efforts to establish more defined boundaries for the technology’s usage. The move is building upon the implementation of major tech regulations that rolled out in recent years targeting cybersecurity, data security, and privacy protection. On Tuesday, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the nation’s top internet watchdog, unveiled a series of proposed measures aimed at regulating the application of facial recognition. The technology has been extensively employed in both the public and private sectors, ranging from facial scans used to authenticate payments in supermarkets to identity verification procedures at airport boarding gates — the latter an increasingly common practice not only in China but also across the U.S. Critics have raised concerns over privacy and bias over the use of facial recognition. They complain that some residential compounds have made facial scans the only way of accessing buildings. There are also concerns about the accuracy and fairness of algorithms, particularly in recognizing the faces of minorities, which could lead to the unjust targeting of certain groups. The proposed measures appear to provide individuals with more rights to opt out of facial recognition in specific circumstances — but they come with limitations. The utilization of facial recognition should be limited to “specific purposes and full necessity,” requiring individual approval or written consent, according to the draft measures. The rules emphasize the need for clear signage in public areas where facial recognition is employed. Venues such as hotels, airports, and museums are prohibited from coercing individuals into accepting facial scans for such reasons as “business operations” or “service enhancements”. Moreover, facial recognition should not serve as the sole means of access to a building. When it comes to collecting facial biometric data from individuals under the age of 14, the consent of their parents or legal guardians must be obtained. Organizations and individuals will bear higher operational costs for using the technology. Entities in possession of facial data on more than 10,000 individuals must register with a local branch of the CAC. The filing needs to explain the purpose of collecting such data and plans for data protection. Unless authorized by individuals, collectors are prohibited from retaining facial images in their original resolution. The proposed measures, If effectively enforced, hold the potential to enhance security within an industry that has been relatively loosely regulated so far and lower the risk of data mishandling. China has seen several major biometric data breaches in recent years, compromising the sensitive information of millions of people. The country has also drawn fire for deploying facial recognition systems to identify people’s ethnicities, particularly in the case of Uyghurs; but that won’t change with the new rules. According to the proposed measures, any organization or individual should refrain from utilizing facial recognition technology to create profiles based on race, ethnic group, religion, health, social class, or other sensitive information, unless it’s deemed necessary for reasons including national security and public security. The proposal is seeking public opinions until September 7."

2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/meatable-35m-cultivated-meat-pork-foodtech/,TechCrunch,Meatable sinks its teeth into $35M to accelerate launch of its cultivated pork products,"Venture capital funding to the cultivated meat industry has largely followed other industries in fewer investments made this year; however, there’s still movement in this sector yet. Here in the United States, cultivated meat companies saw regulatory doors open widely after the Food and Drug Administration cleared Upside Foods and Good Meat in June to sell their cultivated chicken products across the country, and now both are in restaurants. In that same month, Omeat came out of stealth with its technology for making beef. Europe is heating up as well. Just last week, Israel-based Aleph Farms submitted an application in the United Kingdom to sell its cultivated beef steaks under the Aleph Cuts brand in that country. This followed Aleph’s application submitted July 26 for regulatory approval in Switzerland. Meanwhile, U.K.-based Uncommon, formerly known as Higher Steaks, which also makes a wide assortment of cultivated meats, grabbed $30 million in Series A funding. Now Meatable, based in The Netherlands, is adding to that excitement with the announcement of $35 million of its own new financing. The company, initially making pork products, has now raised $95 million in total funding. Agronomics led the new investment and was joined by new investor Invest-NL, which contributed $17 million, according to the company. Existing investors coming back include BlueYard, Bridford, MilkyWay, DSM Venturing and Wise chairman and founder Taavet Hinrikus. Anthony Chow, co-founder of Agronomics, was blunt during an interview when he said that it’s “the worst possible time you could want to raise money,” and that there has been a “real drought of announcements” in the cultivated meat sector, and that many of the more recent announcements, Omeat included, were for investments made “some time ago.” “As far as I’m concerned, this [Meatable’s] is the only material financing that has been completed probably for 18 months, maybe even 24 months, of any meaningful size,” Chow said. TechCrunch has followed Meatable since it picked up $10 million in funding back in 2019. At that time, the company was in its infancy, but had already unveiled its technology which takes animal cells without hurting the animal and then replicates the natural growth process of the cells using its patented “opti-ox” technology combined with pluripotent stem cells, which have the ability to continuously and rapidly multiple. Typically, the cultivated meat process uses precision fermentation technology and bioreactors to make meat. Since its inception five years ago, the company has grown to a team of 100, started production in Singapore and held the first external tastings of its pork products after The Netherlands gave the green light for companies to organize tastings, Meatable’s co-founder and CEO Krijn de Nood told TechCrunch. Oh, and raised $47 million. More recently, de Nood unveiled the company’s ability to slash production time it takes to make fat and muscle, from three weeks to eight days, telling AgFunder in May that while rivals are achieving 50-liter bioreactors, Meatable is currently able to reach 500-liter bioreactors and grow cells at 80 million cells per milliliter, thus enabling the company to make fat and muscle within days. Faster production also helps narrow the gap in production costs, which has been the bane of the cultivated meat industry for years and why we haven’t seen a lot of it on grocery shelves yet. Meanwhile, the new funding will help Meatable, which is still pre-revenue, scale its processes and accelerate the commercialization of its first products, which will include sausages and pork dumplings, in Singapore starting in 2024, de Nood said. The company also plans to establish a presence in the United States in two years. “To build a profitable factory, you will need to put in $50 million to $60 million at least, probably a little bit more,” de Nood said. “We really want to make sure that we spend the capital wisely and first focus on scalability and cost reduction. Then in the next 18 to 24 months start building that large scale.” Editor’s note: Aug. 8, 5:17 a.m. Edited to better explain Meatable’s cultivated meat-making technology."
2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/authors-ai-prosecraft/,TechCrunch,"Authors are losing their patience with AI, part 349235","On Monday morning, numerous writers woke up to learn that their books had been uploaded and scanned into a massive dataset without their consent. A project of cloud word processor Shaxpir, Prosecraft compiled over 27,000 books, comparing, ranking and analyzing them based on the “vividness” of their language. Many authors — including Young Adult powerhouse Maureen Johnson and “Little Fires Everywhere” author Celeste Ng — spoke out against Prosecraft for training a model on their books without consent. Even books published less than a month ago had already been uploaded. After a day full of righteous online backlash, Prosecraft creator Benji Smith took down the website, which had existed since 2017. “I’ve spent thousands of hours working on this project, cleaning up and annotating text, organizing and tweaking things,” Smith wrote. “But in the meantime, ‘AI’ became a thing. And the arrival of AI on the scene has been tainted by early use-cases that allow anyone to create zero-effort impersonations of artists, cutting those creators out of their own creative process.” Smith’s Prosecraft was not a generative AI tool, but authors worried it could become one, since he had amassed a dataset of a quarter billion words from published books, which he found by crawling the internet. Prosecraft would show two paragraphs from a book, one that was “most passive” and one that was “most vivid.” It then placed the books into percentile rankings based on how vivid, how long or how passive it was. “If you’re a writer as a career it’s maddening, in part because style is not the same as writing a fucking whitepaper for a business that needs to be in active voice or whatever,” author Ilana Masad said. “Style is style!” Smith did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but he elaborated on his intentions in his blog post. “Since I was only publishing summary statistics, and small snippets from the text of those books, I believed I was honoring the spirit of the Fair Use doctrine, which doesn’t require the consent of the original author,” Smith wrote. Some authors noted that the excerpts of their books on Prosecraft included major spoilers, causing further frustration. Though Smith apologized, authors remain exasperated. For artists and writers, the recent proliferation of AI tools has created a deeply frustrating game of whack-a-mole. As soon as they opt out of one database, they find that their work has been used to train another AI model, and so on.  “It’s pretty much the norm, from what I can tell, for these sites and projects to do whatever they’re doing first and then hope that no one notices and then disappear or get defensive when they inevitably do,” Masad said.  Generative AI and the technology behind self-publishing have created a perfect storm for scammy activities. Amazon has been flooded with low-quality, AI-generated travel guides, and even AI-generated children’s books. But tools like ChatGPT are basically trained on the sum total of the internet, so this means that real travel writers or children’s books authors could be getting inadvertently plagiarized. Author Jane Friedman wrote in a recent blog post — titled “I’d Rather See My Books Get Pirated Than This” — that she is being impersonated on Amazon, where someone is selling books under her name that appear to be written with an AI. Though Friedman was successful in getting these fake books removed from her Goodreads page, but Amazon initially told her it wouldn’t remove the books for sale unless she had a trademark for her name. After Friedman’s post went viral, Amazon removed the misleading books. Amazon spokesperson Ashley Vanicek told TechCrunch: “We have clear content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale and promptly investigate any book when a concern is raised. We welcome author feedback and work directly with authors to address any issues they raise and where we have made an error, we correct it. We invest heavily to provide a trustworthy shopping experience and protect customers and authors from misuse of our service.” Though both Prosecraft and Amazon ended up capitulating to writers’ requests, there are many other cases in which writers’ concerns aren’t heard — disputes over the use of AI are one reason why Hollywood writers are currently striking, for example. “I don’t think any writer is seriously convinced that AI is going to ruin books because like, well, that’s not how literature works, and everything I’ve seen ChatGPT write as a ‘story’ is just really fucking boring with no voice or real craft or style,” Masad said. But she worries that publishers will be convinced otherwise, and possibly replace marketing and publicity teams with AI-generated promotional content. “It feels really bad,” she said. Update, 8/8/23, 9:30 PM ET: Added comment from Amazon Spokesperson."

GM didn’t give a precise date of when Mexico-based customers can begin ordering its products, only to say it would happen later this year. “Bringing BrightDrop’s products to Mexico is a key move in our mission to decarbonize delivery globally, while helping customers take advantage of the economic benefits of going electric,” BrightDrop’s chief commercial officer Steve Hornyak, said in a statement. The commercial EV business unit — an ecosystem of electric and connected products and software services that launched in January 2021 — is part of GM’s strategy to dominate the EV industry. While it is still a nascent business, BrightDrop has managed to carve out some market share in the commercial EV fleet industry, gaining orders from DHL Express, FedEx and Ryder, among others. The company expanded its business to Canada in late 2022 with the first Canadian-bound EV vans delivered in June of this year. Production of Zevo 600 is ramping up with the smaller Zevo 400 on track to begin in the next few months, the company said. To date, more than 1,000 Zevo 600 vans have been produced at GM’s CAMI Assembly plant in Ontario, Canada. The Zevo 400 will also be produced at the CAMI factory, which is expected to reach 50,000 vans annually by 2025."

As a first for the company, episode one of “Killing It” Season 1 will be available to watch for free on TikTok, parent company NBCUniversal announced Monday. Starting today, viewers can find the first episode on Peacock’s TikTok account, which is broken into five separate parts. Each video is around three to eight minutes long. The move is certainly interesting given the current SAG/WGA strike, which has disrupted the production of many series and movies. It’s likely Peacock’s hope that its new TikTok strategy will bring new viewers to the series since stars are unable to fully promote their work to fans — aside from social media posts. Plus, it’s been a recent trend for TikTok users to upload full-length films and shows. The first three episodes of “Killing It” are also available on YouTube, following a similar move made by competitor Paramount+. Peacock recently uploaded the second episode of Pete Davidson’s “Bupkis” on YouTube one month after it launched on the streaming service in May.  “Killing It” stars “The Office” actor Craig Robinson as bank security guard Craig Foster, who has ambitious plans to become an entrepreneur. He then meets an Uber driver named Jillian (Claudia O’Doherty), who introduces him to the world of state-sponsored python hunting. For some reason, Foster thinks this is a great way to achieve his goals. The second season continues Foster’s wild journey of snake-hunting and making cash. Foster and Jillian own a palmetto berry farm; however, human visitors as well as a snail infestation threaten to ruin their business. The eight-episode season premieres August 17 on Peacock."
2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/lucid-plans-to-start-production-of-gravity-electric-suv-in-late-2024/,TechCrunch,Lucid plans to start production of Gravity electric SUV in late 2024,"Lucid said Monday it will reveal its long-awaited, all-electric Gravity SUV in November with production not kicking off until late 2024. The EV maker, which has experienced a drop in sales for its well-regarded but pricey luxury sedan, had originally planned to begin producing the Gravity at its factory in Arizona in late 2023. That date was later pushed to 2024, but the company never indicated in which quarter production would begin. Lucid gave consumers their first peek at the Gravity back in 2020 during an event to unveil the Air. At the time, the company said the Gravity was already well into the design process. Lucid even had a working prototype, which was spotted in summer 2020 out in the wild. That progress seemed to stagnate as Lucid grappled with production of the Air sedan. Lucid provided its first real update in April 2023 when it began testing pre-production versions of the Gravity SUV on public roads. Lucid has not yet shared the price of its upcoming Gravity SUV, but the automaker might feel pressure to hit a lower price point than originally planned. Over the weekend, Lucid reduced the price of its Air Pure sedan by $5,000 to $82,400, and dropped prices of the Air Touring and Grand Touring versions by $12,400 to $95,000 and $125,600, respectively. Lucid shared the Gravity production date in its second-quarter earnings report, which missed Wall Street expectations. The U.S. automaker said it generated $150.9 million in the second quarter, a 55% uptick from the $97.3 million in the same year-ago period. That still wasn’t enough to beat analysts expectations, which had forecast revenue of $175 million, according to Yahoo Finance data. Last month, Lucid said it delivered 1,404 Air sedans in the second quarter. While that was double the number of EVs it delivered in Q2 2022, it was still about 600 fewer than analysts had expected, pushing shares lower. It was also flat from the first quarter of 2023. Lucid delivered 1,406 vehicles in the first quarter of 2023. The company reported a net loss of $764.2 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $220.4 million in the same year-ago period. On a diluted basis, the company’s net loss in Q2 2022 was $555.3 million. Lucid reported a free cash flow of negative $904 million. However, the automaker confirmed that it raised $3 billion in capital in the second quarter, including $1.8 billion from Saudi Arabia’s PIF. Lucid reported liquidity of $6.25 billion, which Lucid CFO Sherry House says can take the automaker through the start of production for the Lucid Gravity, and into 2025. Lucid’s 2023 outlook remained the same, more or less. In February, the company halved its previous 2023 target from 20,000 to 22,000 vehicles to 10,000 to 14,000 vehicles. On Monday, Lucid said it is on track to deliver “more than 10,000 vehicles” this year. Lucid’s stock climbed 4.5% in after-hours trading immediately after the company reported earnings."
2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/mill-compost-review/,TechCrunch,Can Mill’s tech-heavy food waste bin find its way into kitchens?,"Feeding table scraps to chickens isn’t a new idea. But then again, neither were smoke detectors when Matt Rogers co-founded Nest in 2010, and that worked out pretty well. Rogers is back at it, this time with fellow Nest alumnus Harry Tannenbaum. The duo and their team at Mill have cooked up what is probably the world’s heaviest, most expensive, and most sophisticated kitchen waste bin. Mill’s aim is to eliminate carbon emissions that result from the decomposition of food waste. The startup isn’t the first company to tackle the problem, but it does have a unique approach. Where most other companies focus on large sources like grocery stores or restaurants, Mill is for people’s homes. Its bin grinds and dehydrates food, which the company then collects via the U.S. Postal Service and sells to farmers as chicken feed. As circular economy companies go, this one is pretty clever. Mill sent me one a few months ago to test, and I proceeded to fill it with table scraps, melon rinds, corn cobs, and whatever else was on the extensive list of food waste it said it could devour. I wanted to see if the Mill bin could find its way into our daily routine while reducing the climate impact of our waste stream. The short answer: It mostly did, with some notable hiccups. The bin itself and any consumables are free, included in the subscription ($396 annually or $45 monthly, though the monthly plan tacks on a $75 fee to deliver the bin). Boxes and return shipping for the grounds are also included. The Mill food waste bin isn’t light, but the packaging makes it relatively easy to unbox. Image Credits: Tim De Chant Mill’s bin looks like a very nicely designed kitchen waste bin. The sides are a matte white, the foot pedal that operates the lid is gray, and the lid itself sports a faux blond wood finish with some clever shy tech hidden underneath (more on that later). A button on the lid serves to activate or deactivate the kid/pet lock. At the base of the back, there’s a large hidden charcoal filter. Stepping on the pedal activates a servo that flips open the lid. The actual interior is smaller than the outside suggests. A hefty metal bucket sits within, and inside the bucket is a set of augers that grind the food waste to bits. The setup looks kind of like a giant bread machine. At the end of each day, the bin weighs any new additions and gets to work. The start time is set via a well-designed companion app. It also asks you to name the bin (I named ours “Munchie”). Our kitchen doesn’t have any room near an outlet for the bin, so it sat around the corner in the family room. Since that’s where we watch TV, I set it to start grinding at 10:30 p.m. Mill’s app lets you control basic functions like start time and kid/pet lock. It also includes a comprehensive guide of what should and should not go in the bin. Image Credits: Tim De Chant Once that time arrives, the bin locks with a sudden (and pretty loud) click of a solenoid and grinding commences. Depending on what you’ve scraped in, the process can be relatively quiet or the bin can creak and groan like a 17th-century Spanish galleon. At some point, a heater and fan turn on to dehydrate the scraps. You can keep track of progress in the app or by observing the lights that shine through the faux wood top. It’s a clever bit of tech that tells you when the lid is locked, when the augers are grinding, or when the heaters are drying the grounds. Hidden icons appear from beneath the faux-wood surface of the lid, displaying the status of the machine. Here, it’s locked and grinding. Image Credits: Tim De Chant Under ideal conditions, the whole process is done by the time you’re up for breakfast. In most cases, I’d say that’s true. You can open the app at any time to get an estimate for how long the grinding and drying process will last. Usually, it’s accurate. Sometimes, it’s not. One night, I think I pushed the bin to its limits. With it nearly full of grounds, I added apple peels, an apple core, egg shells, table scraps, and an entire cantaloupe that had been hiding a surprisingly rotten smell inside its rind. I had chopped up the melon as the app suggested. At 10:30 p.m., I was told it would take seven to nine hours to complete the cycle. At 7:30 a.m. the next day, it said it would take another hour and three-quarters. At noon, its estimate hadn’t changed. By 3:30 p.m., the estimate ticked up to 2:10 remaining. Finally, it finished at 6 p.m., 19.5 hours after starting. This wasn’t the first time it had underestimated the time required. Not the end of the world since you can double-click the button on the lid to cancel the cycle and add more scraps, but it does mean that the fan was running literally night and day. It’s not loud, but it’s not quiet, either. Food waste before the Mill bin has a chance to grind it. Image Credits: Tim De Chant When the bin is full, it’ll send you a notification on your phone. To empty, just pop the lid, pull the handle to heave the bucket out of the bin, and dump the grounds into the supplied plastic bag. The grounds are shelf stable. Ours actually smelled pretty good, I thought, kind of like soy sauce. When the bag is full, toss it in an included prelabeled box. The boxes even have adhesive on the flaps so you don’t have to tape it yourself. (For some reason, I really appreciated that.) When ready, just tell the app and it arranges for the USPS to pick it up the next day. I put the box on the front porch in the morning, and our mail carrier picked it up that afternoon. Generally, the process was pretty smooth, with one notable exception. I woke up on Father’s Day morning to a light flashing on the lid. The augers were jammed, though the cause wasn’t immediately obvious. Feeling a bit lazy, I left the bucket in the bin and poked around for about 20 minutes trying to free things up. No luck. After a grind and dry cycle, the waste is significantly smaller. After more cycles, it starts looking like a cross between mulch and coffee grounds. Image Credits: Tim De Chant The next morning, I followed the app’s instructions and removed the bucket and dumped the loose grounds into the mail bag. At first glance, I noticed some of the grounds had been baked into the side of the bucket. I assumed this was the cause and chipped away at it with some disposable chopsticks. After a while, my father-in-law suggested that the jam might have something to do with small strands of fiber that had become wrapped around the augers, so I pulled as much off as I could. After 20 minutes of chipping and yanking, the augers were free once more. Following the jam, Mill told me that there were a few potential causes. Fibrous material had been causing people more problems than expected, so the team had updated the app’s guidance on what should and shouldn’t go in the bin. Corn husks were removed from the approved list, for example (something we hadn’t added). Adding high sugar content scraps to a nearly full bin was also causing jams. (That full cantaloupe might have been to blame.) Lastly, the company has been refining the software that controls cycle time and temperature, cutting an hour of cycle time on average. “Right now, we err on the conservative side to ensure there are no smells or potential for bacteria,” Mill’s Suzy Sammons told me. “As we get more data from customers and our field trials, that software gets better and better at predicting minimum length of cycle time and how much heat we need in the bin, and that reduces the likelihood of a jam.” She added that the company monitors the bins remotely, reaching out to customers with jammed bins to help them troubleshoot it, and that software updates have reduced the likelihood of a jam by at least half. Plus, if any of the modular parts are broken, Mill will send a new one for free. Mill said that early data suggests that people are getting comfortable with using the bins. Almost all the company’s users had used the bin more than twice a day. In a pilot with the city of Tacoma, Washington, more than half of survey respondents said they hadn’t previously used the city’s curbside organics service, meaning they were likely sending food waste to the landfill.

2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/boeings-starliner-crew-capsule-will-not-be-ready-fly-crew-until-march-2024/,TechCrunch,Boeing’s Starliner crew capsule will not be ready fly crew until March 2024,"Boeing and NASA managers are now estimating that the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will not be ready to fly astronauts until March 2024, one of the longest delays yet to hit this already very delayed space program. Boeing’s Starliner capsule is part of NASA’s Commercial Crew program (CCP), one of two spacecraft – the other being SpaceX’s Dragon – the space agency selected in 2014 to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. But while SpaceX’s Dragon has been conducting many astronaut ferrying missions, Boeing’s Starliner has been continually sidelined due to technical issues. To date, Starliner has completed just one un-crewed orbital test flight, which successfully launched last May. A crewed Starliner mission with two NASA astronauts aboard was due to launch in April, until it was delayed to July; then the two firms announced at the beginning of June that the crewed test mission would be postponed yet again, this time due to issues with the capsule’s parachutes and the glass cloth tape that wraps around wire harnesses in the spacecraft. Steve Stich, a manager with NASA’s CCP, told reporters Monday that the team has made a “tremendous amount of progress” since the June update. That progress includes redesigning the parachute “soft links,” or the connectors that attach the parachute to the capsule, and removing a “substantial amount” of the P-213 glass cloth tape had been removed from the crew module. 85% of the tape has been remediated in the upper dome of the craft already, he added. But even as NASA and Boeing make headway on these problems, they’re proving to be very time-intensive. Mark Nappi, Boeing’s Starliner program manager, said that the new parachute would not be delivered until around the beginning of December, with a drop test occurring in mid- to late-November. That means the spacecraft won’t be ready until early March – but that doesn’t mean that the test mission will occur in early March. “We’re now working with NASA Commercial Crew Program, ISS, and [launch provider] ULA on potential launch dates based on our readiness,” Stich said. “It’s a complicated manifesto on ISS and the launch pad of ULA, so we’ll work that throughout the next several weeks and see where we can get that in and we’ll set a launch date.” In spite of this late schedule, NASA and Boeing managers affirmed their confidence that Starliner will be able to fulfill all of the contracted missions under the CCP before the ISS decommissioning in 2030. “There’s really no reason to change our plans,” Nappi said. “We’ve bought hardware for six flights plus [the crewed test flight]. It still fits us well in the window that we have. There’s additional flights are available outside of those six with other customers. So I think we are still committed, like we have been in the past, and will continue on.” In the meantime, costs continue to mount. Boeing has incurred nearly $900 million in losses due to delays in Starliner development as of October last year; no doubt that number will continue to climb until the capsule’s maiden commercial flight."
2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/netflix-updates-thumbs-rating-feature/,TechCrunch,Netflix is making it easier to rate its movies and shows on mobile,"Netflix updated its “Thumbs Up” feature to allow subscribers using the mobile app to like or dislike shows and movies in the middle of watching them. Instead of having to go back to a TV show or movie’s page to give it a thumbs rating, now users can tap the screen at any point– whether they’re in the middle of watching or during the end credits — and click on the Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down or Two Thumbs Up button at the top, then continue watching. The latest update will likely motivate more subscribers to use the feature, which helps Netflix give more personalized recommendations based on what they’ve watched and liked. “You might be so in the zone with a series you really love that you forget to go to its details page to give it a Double Thumbs Up,” a Netflix spokesperson told TechCrunch. “It’s just one easy step that can help us suggest more films and series that are more tailored to your tastes.” The thumbs rating feature has existed for six years. Beforehand, Netflix tried a five-star system, however, this only told the streaming service how well-liked a title was overall and didn’t represent an individual’s viewing habits. According to Netflix, when the company initially tested out thumbs ratings, there was a 200% increase in activity. Last year, the company introduced the Two Thumbs Up button to further help the streamer get better feedback from members."
2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/fusion-ignition-breakthrough-repeated/,TechCrunch,"Scientists repeat breakthrough fusion experiment, netting more power than before","It wasn’t a fluke: Researchers at a Department of Energy (DOE) lab have repeated their breakthrough fusion power experiment. Only this time, the results are even better. On July 30, lasers once again converged on a tiny gold cylinder containing a diamond-coated, deuterium-tritium fuel pellet. When the beams — as many as 192 of them — hit the inside of the cylinder, their energy was turned into X-rays. Those X-rays then bombarded the fuel pellet, forcing it to implode. Last time, the resulting nuclear fusion reaction released 3.15 megajoules of energy. This time, it produced more than 3.5 megajoules, according to the Financial Times. That reportedly exceeds the amount of energy the lasers imparted on the hohlraum, as the cylinder is called, though it’s unclear by how much. The lab confirmed the successful repetition of the experiment and said it intends to report the details at either a scientific conference or in a peer-reviewed publication (likely both). While the most recent experiment won’t garner quite as many headlines as the one in December, it’s just as important. A breakthrough is meaningless if it can’t be replicated. The fact that scientists have achieved net-positive fusion power twice should hearten investors, who bet over $4 billion on the industry in 2021 and 2022. Perhaps most encouraging is the fact that the July 30 shot didn’t simply repeat the December results — it improved on them. We still don’t know what the scientists did to better their numbers, but the bump in energy-out suggests that the new results are not a fluke. Scientists are probably getting better at understanding the quirks of inertial confinement fusion. "
2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/chinese-luxury-ev-brand-zeekr-continues-global-push-into-kazakhstan/,TechCrunch,Chinese luxury EV brand Zeekr continues global push into Kazakhstan,"Zeekr, the luxury electric vehicle brand under China’s Geely Automobile Holdings, says it will launch its Zeekr 001 shooting brake and Zeekr X SUV in Kazakhstan by the fourth quarter of 2023. Kazakhstan, a key market in Central Asia, marks Zeekr’s third geographic expansion announcement in recent months. The two-year-old Chinese automaker also said it plans to begin selling vehicles in Europe and Israel by the end of 2023. The aggressive push into new markets is fueled by the $750 million Series A funding round Zeekr raised in February, which shot the automaker’s post-money valuation up to $13 billion. Prior to that raise, Zeekr said it had filed confidentially for an initial public offering in the U.S. and was reportedly seeking over $1 billion in proceeds. The funds from Zeekr’s Series A were dedicated to technology research and market expansion. At the start of the year, Zeekr posted 3,000 open positions in more than 30 cities around the world. The company has said it wants to expand to most Western European countries by 2026. A look at Zeekr’s most recent job postings hints that the automaker is now also setting its sights on the United States, according to a job listing posted this weekend for a U.S.-based regulatory, policy and compliance manager who will support Zeekr’s U.S. aftermarket efforts. The company did not respond in time to TechCrunch’s request for more information. Zeekr has sold over 100,000 vehicles, predominantly in China, since its launch in 2021. The young automaker has been successful in China in part due to its direct-to-consumer business model, which the company aims to bring to all its new markets. In Kazakhstan, Zeekr’s local partner Orbis Auto, an automotive distributor, will facilitate the development of a sales network and after-sales service in the region. The pre-sale will begin in September with delivery to customers slated for November. Zeekr hasn’t shared at what price point it will sell the Zeekr 001 and X in Kazakhstan. In the Netherlands and Sweden, Zeekr’s first European markets, the flagship 001 is selling for around $65,000, and the X for around $50,000. Both of Zeekr’s international vehicle offerings compete directly with Tesla’s Model Y crossover. The 001 can deliver a range of around 375 miles, and the X has a range of almost 350 miles. Both vehicles include over-the-air software updates."

The lesson? Never take time off. A privately backed tech company going public on the U.S. markets is welcome news. Sadly, while Triller is an interesting business, it may prove too small an offering to fully unlock the domestic IPO market for technology companies. Still, as with the Cava listing, a strong showing could further thaw the IPO market for private companies. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Triller’s IPO is also interesting because it provides some nuance on the social video boom and the costs of content. However, because this company adopts a multipart approach to its market and has made several acquisitions, any comparisons to its chief competitor TikTok will prove limiting. So, let’s dig into the company’s S-1 filing to find out how it’s faring and what’s in store in the months to come. To work! Triller’s S-1 filing is heavy on AI chatter. Calling itself a “global, artificial intelligence powered technology platform,” the app sits between creators, brands and their respective audiences. The company says it focuses on short-form video, “similar to TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube shorts” and other related services. Triller also has loftier aspirations, saying it wants to “rebalance the equation” between creators and platforms, expand the total market for created content, and provide creators with a larger slice of the pie.

2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/cruise-begins-testing-self-driving-vehicles-in-atlanta/,TechCrunch,Cruise begins testing self-driving vehicles in Atlanta,"Cruise said Monday it has started testing its self-driving vehicles in Atlanta as the company continues its ambitious plan to launch its robotaxi service in multiple cities. The announcement confirms previous reporting by TechCrunch that Atlanta would be the next city to see Cruise vehicles on public roads. The company didn’t provide many details in its post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, stating only “more to come.”   The announcement comes just a week since Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt said it would expand to Nashville and hinted that more cities would soon follow.  Cruise also started initial data collection with manually driven autonomous vehicles in Los Angeles. The company told TechCrunch that the operations in Atlanta are currently part of the larger testing strategy. Over the coming weeks, the company will begin initial data collection and testing in multiple cities across the country, according to the company. That doesn’t mean all of these test cities will become robotaxi service cities. Although it appears that Nashville will get the commercial service. Cruise’s self-driving vehicles are already on Nashville streets. A commercial ride-hailing service will follow, Cruise said without providing a specific date. The burst of city expansion announcements is part of Cruise’s previously stated goal to begin testing and even launch a robotaxi service in multiple, new cities, according to the company. A year ago, the company only operated in San Francisco. Cruise has since expanded to Austin, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Nashville and Los Angeles. Cruise isn’t commercially operating in all of these cities just yet. Cruise has established a formula for its rollouts. The company typically enters a new market with test vehicles. Eventually, those vehicles will lose the human safety operator — making it driverless. A ride-hailing service will become available first to employees and then customers who have signed up for the service. The service area and hours often start on a limited basis and slowly expand."
2023-08-07,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/beat-the-clock-6-smart-ways-startups-can-use-lawyers-effectively/,TechCrunch,Beat the clock: 6 smart ways startups can use lawyers effectively,"Without informing their board, a certain startup had amassed $150,000 legal fees in just three months. The investor team I was part of grilled the founder to explain why. He told us the fees were for documents involving business formation, funding, various agreements, and intellectual property registrations. Because fees like this can sink an early-stage startup, it’s critical that founders of emerging companies know cost-effective ways to use lawyers. As a founder, you can get the most out of legal help by deploying a few smart strategies that won’t break the bank or blow your budget. Not everything you do requires a lawyer: You simply need to know when to engage your attorney, how much to spend, and when to do it yourself. Your startup needs the right legal structure. Structure depends on various factors: the nature of the business, its growth potential, funding requirements, liability considerations, and tax implications. Most startups are formed either as an LLC (limited liability company) or a C-Corp. Your business lawyer will help determine which structure best fits your company. All startups enter into agreements and contracts with employees, suppliers, strategic partners, distributors and partners. It’s wise to have a lawyer help draft contracts to ensure your startup’s interests are protected. These three key areas require legal coverage:


			Not everything you do requires a lawyer: You simply need to know when to engage your attorney, how much to spend, and when to do it yourself.

 IP (intellectual property) protection: Identify and protect your IP, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. Fundraising and securities law compliance: Your capital raises from investors require securities laws compliance. These laws were established to ensure transparency in investing. As an entrepreneur, you provide accurate information to your investors about their potential investment. This includes all associated risks. A lawyer will advise and help your startup navigate the process to ensure your company is compliant. Employment law: When a startup hires employees, the business must comply with state, federal and different country laws that include operating and promoting a fair and inclusive workplace. To lay out the company’s policies, you’ll need an employee manual that an attorney can review or help create. It’s equally important to have relevant agreements completed, such as employee “IP assignments.” This means an employee who creates intellectual property for the company, such as patents, trademarks, trade secrets or copyrights assigns all rights of ownership to the company. My six smart ways for your startup to use lawyers effectively follow. Before hiring a lawyer, ask other entrepreneurs, your board and advisers for referrals to prospective attorneys. Find out what they’re paying for legal services in your area. This will give you a good sense of how much you’ll pay and what to budget for. Ask about education, experiences and how satisfied they are with their lawyer. You’re better off with an attorney who specializes in the entrepreneurial ecosystem and has many years of experience with entrepreneurs. Angel investor groups often have alliances with sponsoring law firms that specialize in the startup space. Because these law firms understand the inherent risks for emerging companies, they often have experience on all sides of the complex business and intellectual property issues that startups are likely to encounter.

2023-08-06,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/06/ant-financial-paytm-vijay-shekhar-sharma/,TechCrunch,Ant Financial sells Paytm stake worth $628M to Vijay Shekhar Sharma in no-cash deal,"Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive of Paytm, has entered into a deal with Ant Financial to acquire a 10.30% stake in the Indian financial services firm in a move that appears to be orchestrated to cut the Noida-headquartered giant’s exposure to the Chinese company. Resilient Asset Management, a firm fully owned by Sharma, is acquiring the stake from Ant Financial, Paytm said. The deal is being executed at Paytm’s share closing price on August 4, making the 10.3% Paytm stake worth $628 million. The move allows Paytm to pare its exposure to Ant Financial, making the Indian firm more suitable for future licenses in the country. Paytm’s move “removes overhang on the stock from the risk that Antfin in future may look to reduce its stake leading to more supply. Furthermore, Sharma buying the stake at Friday’s close indicates his confidence in the story with a ‘skin in the game’ approach show,” Bank of America analysts wrote in a note Monday. “This event also reduces risk that some other strategic investor coming who would have a major stake similar to that of Sharma. We believe a Chinese shareholder (Antfin) ceasing to be the largest shareholder, would also directionally be positive for the company fundamentals.” Neither Sharma nor Resilient are making any cash payment in the deal, which is being executed off-market. Furthermore, Sharma has made no pledge, guarantee, or other value assurance directly or otherwise to Ant Financial, Paytm said. Paytm jumped over 6.5% on the news. Following the deal, Sharma’s stake in Paytm will increase to 19.42%, whereas Ant Financial’s shareholding will pare down to 13.5%, Paytm said. The move follows a turnaround at Paytm, which had a lackluster listing but has improved its finances significantly in recent quarters. Sharma’s Resilient will issue optionally convertible debentures to Ant Financial, allowing the Chinese giant to “retain economic value of the 10.30% stake,” Paytm said. Ant Financial doesn’t have a representation on Paytm’s board. “I am proud of Paytm’s role as a true champion of made-in-India financial innovation, and our achievements in revolutionizing mobile payments and contributing to formal financial services inclusion in the country. As we announce this transfer of ownership, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Ant for their unwavering support and partnership over the past several years,” Sharma said in a prepared statement."
2023-08-06,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/06/taking-another-look-at-venture-debt/,TechCrunch,Taking another look at venture debt,"Silicon Valley Bank’s nosedive has soured many on venture debt, and for early-stage companies, it bears being cautious. As an option for growth-stage companies with more predictable cash flow, however, things may be a little different. TechCrunch+ spoke with David Spreng, founder and CEO of Runway Growth Capital and author of “All Money Is Not Created Equal” to help to clear up some of the misconceptions that surround debt. Even though the interest on venture debt is usually astronomical, venture debt’s main advantage is that it doesn’t require startups to give up any equity. Not diluting shares in order to raise money can have a huge impact on the economic outcomes, and raising money through a bank loan is usually much easier than raising a round of venture capital. Though taking on debt isn’t always the best option, there are some circumstances you may find yourself in where it makes the most sense. Venture debt is a way of borrowing money, usually between $1 million and $100 million, without any tangible assets to secure it. This is where it differs from a business loan. You might be able to get yourself an unsecured business loan early on in your company’s life, but it’ll be for a relatively small sum of money and the interest rates on it will be on the high side. In some cases, founders have to supply a personal guarantee when they take one out. A secured loan, on the other hand, takes tangible assets as collateral. Startups might not have a whole lot by the way of tangible assets, but they could have other valuable assets. This is where venture debt comes in. Venture debt is borrowing that’s secured against your intangible assets: predictable future revenue, your IP, and your future VC backing, for example. There are effectively two types of venture debt: early stage and late stage. Early-stage debt tends to be offered on the basis of a startup’s VC backers. Spreng’s own shop, Runway, on the other hand, provides only late-stage debt. It’s for companies that are on the verge of profitability but need an injection of funds to help them obtain the growth they need in order to reach it.  "
2023-08-06,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/06/thomson-reuters-ai-jobs/,TechCrunch,"How Thomson Reuters is leveraging AI to enhance productivity, rather than replace jobs","Thomson Reuters is a venerable news and information organization, with its historical roots stretching all the way back to the 19th century. The two companies merged in 2008 and provide a combination of news and specialized information in areas like law, trade and accounting. The organization processes a ton of information every year, relying on a staff of 27,000 subject experts and journalists around the world to generate a variety of content. As generative AI has emerged in recent months, it would surely be tempting to use it in the newsroom, as other news organizations have done, and see this capability as an opportunity to reduce staff, cut costs and automate, automate, automate. While the company sees the benefits of AI for both its employees and customers, it is not in the worker replacement camp, at least not yet. Instead, it sees AI as a way to help customers find information faster, and help its employees operate more efficiently, removing the mundane parts of the job so people can do what they do best. It would be easy to think that an organization as old as Thomson Reuters would simply dismiss technology like generative AI, but the company tells TechCrunch+ that it is all in when it comes to the latest technology, as it looks for ways to improve and modernize its operations. Chief people officer Mary Alice Vuicic, says Thomson Reuters sees automation as only part of the story, and if you concentrate on that, you may miss some of AI’s biggest benefits. “We think AI is a phenomenal opportunity for the professionals we serve through our products, and equally internally for our colleagues,” Vuicic told TechCrunch+. “We think it’s a tool for augmenting the potential of our colleagues in new ways, helping them do work better, faster, more effectively.” That said, she also recognizes that large language models (LLMs) do not always provide perfect answers, and Thomson Reuters is already relying on internal expertise to help correct the models.

2023-08-06,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/06/how-a-frugal-approach-helped-land-lula-more-runway-amid-a-market-downturn-fintech/,TechCrunch,How a frugal approach helped land Lula more runway amid a market downturn,"It was an eventful week in fintech startup land, and we did our best to capture the highlights. We covered some raises, new product lines, at least one M&A deal and more. Oh, and if you want to receive this in your inbox in the future, sign up here. One of the coolest things about covering startups is covering them in their earlier stages and then watching them grow and raise more money over time. During the 2021 funding boom, it was very common for companies that I had previously covered to raise another round at a higher valuation. During this quieter funding season in 2023, it’s far less so. But last week, I did get to report on Lula, a startup that aims to be the “Stripe for insurance.” Twin brothers Michael and Matthew Vega-Sanz started the company at the age of 24 in early 2020 and went on to raise an $18 million Series A (which I covered here) in 2021. This past week, they announced a $35.5 million Series B co-led by NextView Ventures and Khosla Ventures. Unfortunately, they did not disclose valuation, noting only that it was up “5x” compared to two years ago. With so many flat and down rounds taking place, though, such a big spike is certainly impressive. I was curious as to how the company managed this feat in this current funding environment. In an interview, Michael told me that he and his brother/partner could feel that the market was about to take a turn in late 2021/early 2022. And while they didn’t need to yet raise more money, they sensed that it might be harder to do so when the time came. So they did something that was counter to a lot of other fintechs during that time: They tightened their belts. They adopted a more frugal mindset internally and when making new hires. “In the last 12 months it certainly has been challenging trying to get the entire company to buy into this frugal, cost-conscious mentality,” Michael told me during an interview. “But we did, and I think that was the reason why the Series B process went smoothly for us. And to be honest with you, we expected it to be really, really, really difficult. We braced ourselves, and said, ‘Let’s go ahead and prepare like this is going to be a race that takes six to eight months. Let’s go ahead and prepare like this is going to be a race that none of our internal investors want to step up. Let’s just go ahead and brace for the worst.'” The strategy seems to have worked. Revenue is up over 20x compared to last year and while at first it was hard, hiring quality employees actually ended up being not too difficult when candidates saw the value of a company that was focused on reducing cash burn and avoiding down rounds and layoffs. “I think the fact that we just stuck to the core principles of building a really strong fundamentally sound business and being able to sustain that for the last two years — even in this crazy market — I think that primed us really well. And, we went from a few $100,000 in monthly recurring revenue in the first quarter of last year,” Michael said. “Today we’re doing a few million dollars in monthly revenue. And I think it’s important to call out that this is not gross written premium — this is actual revenue recurring revenue.” Early investor NextView Ventures tripled (quadrupled?) down on its investment in the company, co-leading Lula’s latest round. Lee Hower — managing partner at NextView, co-founder of LinkedIn and early PayPal employee — actually first met the Vega-Sanz brothers at the end of 2018 when the pair was more focused on trying to build a ride-sharing network business. He kept in touch with them and took notice when they pivoted to focus directly on building an API for insurance needs. In 2020, his firm made a pre-seed investment in the company, which went on to participate in his firm’s virtual accelerator program that was launched that summer. “The Lula team took this from an idea to live with paying customers in their first market segment within about 5 months. They quickly ramped to seven-figure recurring revenue just a few months after that.” Now Lula is targeting to reach $100 million in annual recurring revenue sometime over the next three to four quarters — and profitability even sooner. It’s come a long way from the days that co-founder Matthew says he remembers “photo shopping techcrunch headlines in my dorm room and hanging it on our walls hoping to one day get a story.” It’s a type of growth story we’re not used to hearing as much these days. — Mary Ann As the parent of two teenagers, I’d like to know that I am setting them up to handle whatever financial things they may face in their adulthood. However, sometimes you need help. I’m not that savvy with investments — I leave that up to the experts that I pay to monitor my retirement portfolio (something my parents, in turn, taught me to set up out of college) — which is why I was eager to write about Bloom this week. The venture-backed company was started by Allan Maman and Sam Yang a few years ago and offers a zero-commission stock investing tool for teenage investors that includes a brokerage account and teaches those aged 13 and older how to build wealth through interactive lessons on investing, stocks and finance. Maman and Yang didn’t want to provide any old content, either. They developed an Instagram-like structure to their educational material, and when a user aces one of the quizzes, they get rewarded with points to spend within the app. Bloom just passed 1 million downloads and over 10 million games played in the app. For those of you who are cash-conscious, it costs $15 a month or $120 for a year to utilize the app, and there are no minimums for the account balance. Though Bloom started out with a focus on younger teens, Maman and Yang saw people aged 18 to 25 flocking to the site, so now they are leaning into that demographic going forward. Some companies targeting financial education for teens and Gen Z, like Copper, Step and Greenlight, are expanding in the “setting up a bank account and debit card” phase, so it is nice to see an app take on investing beyond just offering a free trade. — Christine Image Credits: Bloom If it feels like every week a different spend management company is announcing new features, it’s because it nearly is. This past week alone, Ramp, Brex and Rho shared their own respective news. Ramp announced its entrance into the procurement space, added new customers in Shopify and Virgin Voyages, and had annualized revenue of “several hundred million” dollars. Meanwhile, Brex and Rho both announced AI-powered accounts payables (AP) products — both of which interestingly were built in partnership with AI startups. Brex has teamed up with companies such as Scale AI and Photon while Rho has partnered with OpenAI (with whom it shares an investor). On the topic of bill pay, Bluevine is another fintech company that also recently announced a new AP product. Bluevine started as an SMB lender but has since grown its offering over time with digital banking aimed at small businesses. The company via email also disputed Brex’s claim that it was the only fintech that offered its AP product for free, with a spokesperson for the company emailing me to say: “Bluevine also offers our AP solutions for ‘free’ from within the Bluevine Business Checking account (no min balance, no monthly fees, etc.) — with the only costs associated with money movement (wires, cross-border, etc.).” Meanwhile, Zip also reached out to say that its CEO Rujul Zaparde believes that the expanding ecosystem in the procurement space “is a clear indicator that there is growing demand for this type of tech.” He subtly took a dig at Ramp’s new offering by adding: “It can be notoriously difficult to serve enterprise procurement teams effectively. In an industry known for years-long implementations and 100-page PDF guides describing to employees how to correctly make a purchase, balancing the need for ease of adoption via a modern user experience while capturing the needed procurement governance, vendor risk controls and executive reporting requirements can be incredibly challenging.” TechCrunch covered Zip’s latest raise of $100 million at a $1.5 billion valuation, and I talked to Rujul myself when I covered the company’s $42 million raise in May of 2022. — Mary Ann Mary Ann reported on Better.com‘s mixed news as of late. On the positive side for the company, an SEC investigation did not recommend an enforcement action against the digital mortgage lender after an investigation on the part of the SEC to determine if violations of the federal securities laws had occurred. Still, amazingly, the company continues to try to go public — despite recording large net losses quarter after quarter and downsizing its staff by 91% over the past 20 months or so. More here. As reported by Aisha Malik: “Allo, a new financial app that can be described as Headspace for personal finance, is aiming to help users meaningfully engage with their finances without becoming overwhelmed with numbers and spending. The idea behind Allo is to help users create a mindful money practice that allows them to approach their earnings, spending, saving, investing and giving with a sense of fulfillment.” Read more here. Also from Aisha: Apple announced last week that “Apple Card’s high-yield Savings account offered by Goldman Sachs has reached over $10 billion in deposits from users since launching in April. The Savings account offers an APY (annual percentage yield) of 4.15%.” Read more here. It’s also important to note that Goldman Sachs is looking to get out of the partnership, so it’s not clear how that would affect things, if at all, moving forward. Robinhood beats revenue estimates, shares fall on decline in users: The company also was profitable during the three-month period — for the first time ever. Despite that good news, Third Bridge analyst Andrew McGee noted that Robinhood’s “large drop” in monthly active users was concerning given the believe that MAUs “were highly correlated with stock market returns.” He added, via an email statement: “MAUs were highlighted as the highest risk area for Robinhood by our specialists due to historical trends demonstrating that when retail traders lose significant amounts of money, they never come back. Additionally, the specialists believe the customers that left during the GameStop incident won’t return due to a lack of trust in the company.” McGee also warned that Robinhood needs to be careful if interest rates decrease to offset lost net interest revenue through additional products or increasing transactional volumes. Makes sense considering we won’t be seeing these rates forever. KPMG issues its latest Pulse of Fintech report, looking at the first half of 2023. The report noted that “while both total fintech funding and the number of fintech deals globally dropped from $63.2 billion across 2,885 deals in H2’22 to $52.4 billion across 2,153 deals in H1’23, the news wasn’t all negative. Despite market turbulence and declining funding in both the EMEA and ASPAC regions, the Americas saw fintech funding climb from $28.9 billion in H2’22 to $36 billion in H1’23.” That’s a surprise! And completely in line with our lead story on Lula above, KPMG found that insurtech continues to attract interest in the Americas and the U.S. specifically, noting that “funding in the space will likely remain strong in the long term, as the technologies being used by many legacy insurance is quite antiquated — investors recognize that there is a real opportunity to upgrade.” Meanwhile, AI officially overtook fintech as the hottest investment category in the second quarter of 2023, at least according to recent State of Venture report findings from AngelList and Brex. Specifically and unsurprisingly, the report found that the AI/ML sector showed “incredible” momentum in the first quarter of 2023, capturing the second highest share of investment volume and sixth highest share of capital deployed. Then in the second quarter,  the AI/ML sector captured 14% of investment volume and 13.4% of capital deployed. Meanwhile, fintech was the second most popular investment activity sector in the second quarter but showed a “marked decline” over the previous three-month period. When it came to capital deployed, fintech actually ranked below AI, food and beverage and health tech in the second quarter of 2023 with 7.7% of dollars deployed. Income and employment API Pinwheel is now American Express’ direct deposit switching partner for its new checking account. TechCrunch covered Pinwheel’s last raise — a $50 million Series B at a $500 million valuation — here.

Too early when they include details that turn out to be awkward or irrelevant when technology moves in a different direction. Too late when they wait for certainty and meanwhile leave important areas unregulated and vulnerable to fraud. The English Law Commission, in its final report on digital assets, proposes to solve this riddle with a new approach that might make the U.K. a jurisdiction of choice for DeFi and other digital asset structures.

			A lack of clarity in how they are treated by the courts prevents DeFi and the digital asset economy from developing more widely.

 As a holder of NFTs or a participant in DeFi, you might think that legal uncertainty does not affect you — cryptoassets exist independently of any legal system and do not need to be controlled by regulations. But a lack of clarity in how they are treated by the courts prevents DeFi and the digital asset economy from developing more widely. Here are a few examples:"
2023-08-05,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/05/4-ways-generative-ai-makes-founders-more-interesting-to-journalists/,TechCrunch,4 ways generative AI makes founders more interesting to journalists,"The advent of generative AI will lead to a tectonic shift in how startups do PR over the next few years. In July, the Associated Press became the first major news company to sign a deal with OpenAI, while media job cuts have reached record highs. Gutted newsrooms could stymie one of the greatest engines of startup growth. While generative AI will enhance the capabilities of many publications, they’re also creeping onto news sites in ways we can’t foresee while journalists are laid off. Inevitably, some startups will choose to use AI to churn out thought leadership and PR content. The problem with that is, if anyone and everyone can do something, then it becomes devoid of value. If any founder can ask ChatGPT to create a listicle on “5 reasons e-commerce will grow in 2023,” then the internet will become even more saturated with that kind of content. And that content is professional-sounding, yes, but impersonal, starved of real-life narratives, and flair-less.


			Startups that want to be seen amid the flurry as AI enters the media will need to remember that what most people really want is a human story.


The good news is, this will actually push startup PR to evolve. In-house PR teams will want to elevate their content above the tedious noise. PR agencies will strive to show startups why they shouldn’t be using ChatGPT to do their job. Editors will scream out for original articles over rehashed content. PR and human-written thought leadership will have to sharply differentiate itself from the unoriginal content of overused AI. Seeing a strong voice of reason or controversy, a provocative response to current events and rapidly unfolding topics — that’s something people are always hungry for. It’s alive, shaped by the world around us, and helps us make sense of it. Ironically, AI could make PR more responsive, human, relevant. So, where do AI’s limits lie — and where will successful PR strategies shine in the age of ChatGPT? AI does not exist in the present. It’s trained on past datasets, but it can’t follow today’s news, much less if that news hasn’t been published online. I know from my PR work that journalists take a heightened interest in a business leader when they can speak knowledgeably (and quickly) on unfolding events. As do readers: 62% of professionals want to see thought leadership on current trends. But how will generative AI change this scenario? It’s likely that the role of journalists will move away from what’s generally achievable by AI — generic advice articles, listicles, etc. — and they’ll have more time to write articles on current events and hard-hitting trends, imbued with relevant commentary. So, that’s what they’ll want to see more of from founders — commentary on the Senate just passing a new immigration bill and how that will affect tech talent; a thought piece on how startups can leverage a new TikTok trend for growth. An effective PR strategy will involve a shift in behavior: Other than being timely, the difference between you and ChatGPT is that you have friends. You have your finger on the pulse of specific “offline” circles in a way that’s not possible for an AI bot. Journalists will value you being able to bring insights on the word on the street — what the sentiment is over X news story among your peers, the conversations you have with colleagues over the state of the industry. Finally, you can also peer into the future. A true industry expert can read what’s happening on the ground — not just online — ask for peers’ opinion on a matter of interest, and offer predictions on where a trend is going. Be careful only to do so when your margin of error is small. "

If you missed the news this week, no biggie. That’s what WiR is for. We’ll fill you in. In this edition, we cover Reed Jobs, the son of Steve Jobs, who is launching a new venture fund to back cancer treatments; China’s cutthroat e-commerce tactics; and fan-fiction writers rallying against a proposed U.S. law that could lead to greater surveillance online. Elsewhere, we pull back the curtains on Google Assistant reportedly pivoting to generative AI; NASA launching its own streaming service, called NASA+; and Walmart buying VC firm Tiger Global’s remaining Flipkart stake. If you haven’t already, sign up here to get WiR in your inbox every Saturday. Now, on with the recap. Jobs fights cancer: Reed Jobs, the 31-year-old son of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs, is stepping into the spotlight with a new venture capital firm to invest in emerging cancer treatments. Called Yosemite — after the national park where Reed’s parents were wed — the firm has already closed its debut fund with $200 million from prominent individuals and institutions, including MIT,  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and John Doerr. Fight of the Chinese e-commerce giants: The battle between two of China’s largest e-commerce firms, Temu and Shein, is heating up. Temu recently filed a court document in the U.S. accusing fast-fashion giant Shein of anticompetitive practices, which was a response to Shein’s accusations in March that Temu “willfully and flagrantly infringed Shein’s exclusive and valuable trademark and copyright rights.” Fan-fiction writers protest online safety law:This week, fan-fiction writers penned letters to their senators, expressing their concerns that the U.S. Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) could change the internet forever. KOSA has been met with a flood of opposition from a variety of internet communities; detractors worry that the bill could restrict queer kids’ access to affirming online resources or make it easier for local governments to surveil abortion seekers. Google Assistant embraces generative AI: Google is reportedly planning a major revamp of Google Assistant, its AI-powered assistant, as the generative AI race heats up. An internal email suggests that the new and improved Google Assistant will be “powered by the latest LLM [large language model] technology” — tech similar, presumably, to that underpinning AI systems like OpenAI’s GPT-4. NASA gets into streaming: NASA announced this week that it’s going to launch a new streaming service later this year called NASA+. The ad-free, no-cost streaming portal will include live coverage of future launches, documentaries and new original series that will be exclusively available on the platform. Walmart fully acquires Flipkart: Walmart has paid $1.4 billion to buy out VC firm Tiger Global’s remaining holding of Flipkart shares as the retail giant further expands its stake in the Indian e-commerce startup. Walmart, which spent $16 billion on a 77% stake in Flipkart in 2018, held 72% share in the firm as of last year, according to an analysis by market intelligence firm Tracxn. Apple gives X a pass: After weeks of changes to its social handles, branding on its interface, a redirect on the web and lots of chatter from its owner, Twitter the app has finally changed its name on the App Store to X. The single-letter name may have an exception: Apple typically doesn’t allow developers to name their apps as a single character. SpaceX tests a “pancake”: SpaceX conducted a full-pressure test of a new water deluge system — which CEO Elon Musk described as “a mega-steel pancake” — for its Starship launch vehicle, as the company looks to resolve one of the biggest problems that cropped up during the orbital flight test in April. Looking for podcasts to pass the time? You’re in luck. TechCrunch has a wealth of content for your listening pleasure. On Equity, the crew hosted Sara Mauskopf, the CEO and co-founder of the childcare marketplace Winnie, to discuss the state of care as a venture-backable category, where startups can find the most impact and business results and the pressures of fundraising-driven growth in care-oriented markets. This week’s episode of Found, meanwhile, focused on ReBokeh, a startup that created an app that applies filters to allow people with low vision to see better. The founder and CEO, Rebecca Rosenberg, talked about how her own experience with having low vision inspired the product and what it was like building ReBokeh as an undergrad when everything went remote in 2020. And over on Chain Reaction, Jesse Pollak, head of protocols at Coinbase, chatted about the launch of Base, a new Ethereum-based blockchain that’s set to launch on Coinbase in just a few days. Pollak dove into what’s going on and why it matters, as well as where he sees Base going in the distant future.

elcome to the TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the daily TechCrunch+ column where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here. Retaining mobile app subscribers is harder than it was last year, but paywall optimization and gamified UX can help. Also, cyber insurance providers are pushing companies to up their security game, and that’s mostly a good thing. — Anna Average mobile subscription prices have been growing month over month across all subscription tiers since the beginning of 2022, according to a recent report on the state of in-app subscriptions in the U.S. from Adapty, a company that helps developers drive more revenue from their apps. “We believe there are several reasons for this trend, including escalating inflation and higher cost per acquisition (CPA) prices for paid ads,” Adapty notes in its report, which is based on data from apps whose audiences add up to 6.5 million users. While pricing trends are a helpful benchmark, the most actionable part of the report has to do with paywalls, one of the key elements that Adapty helps its clients optimize. The takeaway here is that these should be the focus of much A/B testing: According to the report, app revenue is growing exponentially with the number of paywall experiments.  "
2023-08-05,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/05/secondary-venture-sales-tiger-flipkart/,TechCrunch,Deal Dive: Most secondary sales in venture won’t look like Tiger’s Flipkart deal,"A few months ago, it looked like all the pieces had fallen into place for a hot secondaries summer: Buyers were coming back to market, some companies and sellers were getting desperate, and the bid-ask spread — the difference of what buyers are willing to pay and the price sellers are setting — was tightening. Tiger Global’s recent secondary deal, in which it sold its stake in Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart to Walmart for $1.4 billion, shows that the market has started moving. But this transaction shouldn’t be taken as a bellwether of what’s ahead for venture’s secondary market this year. To recap, Walmart is already a majority shareholder in Flipkart, and this new deal valued the online marketplace at $35 billion, a minor 7% valuation haircut from its last publicly announced valuation of $37.6 billion. Tiger Global had invested a total of $1.2 billion in Flipkart over multiple funding rounds since 2010, according to TechCrunch reporting. It sold off a bunch of its shares over time to net a collective $3.5 billion return, which is not a bad payout by any standards. Tiger Global declined to comment. A Walmart spokesperson said, “We value Tiger Global’s involvement and support over the last several years. We remain confident in the future of Flipkart and are even more positive about the opportunity in India today than when we first invested.” Sure, one could argue — rightly so — that this deal is a little outside the venture market, considering Flipkart has been majorly owned by Walmart since 2018. But, Tiger Global has been shopping around a lot of its venture stakes, too — which could include companies like Brex, Chime and Databricks — and I think it’s good to mull over why the investment firm likely won’t get a similar deal for its venture stakes.

2023-08-05,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/05/this-week-in-ai-experiments-retirements-and-extinction-events/,TechCrunch,"This week in AI: Experiments, retirements, and extinction events","Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as AI is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of the last week’s stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own. YouTube has begun experimenting with AI-generated summaries for videos on the watch and search pages, though only for a limited number of English-language videos and viewers. Certainly, the summaries could be useful for discovery — and accessibility. Not every video creator can be bothered to write a description. But I worry about the potential for mistakes and biases embedded by the AI. Even the best AI models today tend to “hallucinate.” OpenAI freely admits that its latest text-generating-and-summarizing model, GPT-4, makes major errors in reasoning and invents “facts.” Patrick Hymel, an entrepreneur in the health tech industry, wrote about the ways in which GPT-4 makes up references, facts and figures without any identifiable link to real sources. And Fast Company tested ChatGPT’s ability to summarize articles, finding it . . . quite bad. One can imagine AI-generated video summaries going off the deep end, given the added challenge of analyzing the content contained within the videos. It’s tough to evaluate the quality of YouTube’s AI-generated summaries. But it’s well established that AI isn’t all that great at summarizing text content. YouTube subtly acknowledges that AI-generated descriptions are no substitute for the real thing. On the support page, it writes: “While we hope these summaries are helpful and give you a quick overview of what a video is about, they do not replace video descriptions (which are written by creators!).” Here’s hoping the platform doesn’t roll out the feature too hastily. But considering Google’s half-baked AI product launches lately (see its attempt at a ChatGPT rival, Bard), I’m not too confident. Here are some other AI stories of note from the past few days: Dario Amodei is coming to Disrupt: We’ll be interviewing the Anthropic co-founder about what it’s like to have so much money. And AI stuff too. Google Search gains new AI features: Google is adding contextual images and videos to its AI-powered Search Generative Experience (SGE), the generative AI-powered search feature announced at May’s I/O conference. With the updates, SGE now shows images or videos related to the search query. The company also reportedly is pivoting its Assistant project to a Bard-like generative AI. Microsoft kills Cortana: Echoing the events of the Halo series of games from which the name was plucked, Cortana has been destroyed. Fortunately this was not a rogue general AI but an also-ran digital assistant whose time had come. Meta embraces generative AI music: Meta this week announced AudioCraft, a framework to generate what it describes as “high-quality,” “realistic” audio and music from short text descriptions, or prompts. Google pulls AI Test Kitchen: Google has pulled its AI Test Kitchen app from the Play Store and the App Store to focus solely on the web platform. The company launched the AI Test Kitchen experience last year to let users interact with projects powered by different AI models such as LaMDA 2. Robots learn from small amounts of data: On the subject of Google, DeepMind, the tech giant’s AI-focused research lab, has developed a system that it claims allows robots to effectively transfer concepts learned on relatively small datasets to different scenarios. Kickstarter enacts new rules around generative AI: Kickstarter this week announced that projects on its platform using AI tools to generate content will be required to disclose how the project owner plans to use the AI content in their work. In addition, Kickstarter is mandating that new projects involving the development of AI tech detail info about the sources of training data the project owner intends to use. China cracks down on generative AI: Multiple generative AI apps have been removed from Apple’s China App Store this week, thanks to new rules that’ll require AI apps operating in China to obtain an administrative license. Stable Diffusion releases new model: Stability AI launched Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, a text-to-image model that the company describes as its “most advanced” release to date. Stability claims that the model’s images are “more vibrant” and “accurate” colors and have better contrast, shadows and lighting compared to artwork from its predecessor. The future of AI is video: Or at least a big part of the generative AI business is, as Haje has it. AI.com has switched from OpenAI to X.ai: It’s extremely unclear whether it was sold, rented, or is part of some kind of ongoing scheme, but the coveted two-letter domain (likely worth $5 million to $10 million) now points to Elon Musk’s X.ai research outfit rather than the ChatGPT interface. AI is working its way into countless scientific domains, as I have occasion to document here regularly, but you could be forgiven for not being able to list more than a few specific applications offhand. This literature review at Nature is as comprehensive an accounting of areas and methods where AI is taking effect as you’re likely to find anywhere, as well as the advances that have made them possible. Unfortunately it’s paywalled, but you can probably find a way to get a copy. A deeper dive into the potential for AI to improve the global fight against infectious diseases can be found here at Science, and a few takeaways can be found in UPenn’s summary. One interesting part is that models built to predict drug interactions could also help “unravel intricate interactions between infectious organisms and the host immune system.” Disease pathology can be ridiculously complicated, so epidemiologists and doctors will probably take any help they can get. Asteroid spotted, ma’am. Image Credits: UW Another interesting example, with the caveat that not every algorithm should be called AI, is this multi-institutional work algorithmically identifying “potentially hazardous” asteroids. Sky surveys generate a ton of data and sorting through it for faint signals like asteroids is tough work that’s highly susceptible to automation. The 600-foot 2022 SF289 was found during a test of the algorithm on ATLAS data. “This is just a small taste of what to expect with the Rubin Observatory in less than two years, when HelioLinc3D will be discovering an object like this every night,” said UW’s Mario Jurić. Can’t wait! A sort of halo around the AI research world is research being done on AI — how it works and why. Usually these studies are pretty difficult for non-experts to parse, and this one from ETHZ researchers is no exception. But lead author Johannes von Oswald also did an interview explaining some of the concepts in plain English. It’s worth a read if you’re curious about the “learning” process that happens inside models like ChatGPT. Improving the learning process is also important, and as these Duke researchers find, the answer is not always “more data.” In fact, more data can hinder a machine learning model, said Duke professor Daniel Reker: “It’s like if you trained an algorithm to distinguish pictures of dogs and cats, but you gave it one billion photos of dogs to learn from and only one hundred photos of cats. The algorithm will get so good at identifying dogs that everything will start to look like a dog, and it will forget everything else in the world.” Their approach used an “active learning” technique that identified such weaknesses in the dataset, and proved more effective while using just 1/10 of the data. A University College London study found that people were only able to discern real from synthetic speech 73% of the time, in both English and Mandarin. Probably we’ll all get better at this, but in the near term the tech will probably outstrip our ability to detect it. Stay frosty out there."
2023-08-05,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/05/letmespy-spyware-shuts-down-wiped-server/,TechCrunch,Spyware maker LetMeSpy shuts down after hacker deletes server data,"Poland-based spyware LetMeSpy is no longer operational and said it will shut down after a June data breach wiped out its servers, including its huge trove of data stolen from thousands of victims’ phones. In a notice on its website in both English and Polish, LetMeSpy confirmed the “permanent shutdown” of the spyware service and that it would cease operations by the end of August. The notice said LetMeSpy is blocking users from logging in or signing up with new accounts. A separate notice on LetMeSpy’s former login page, which no longer functions, confirmed earlier reports that the hacker who breached the spyware operation also deleted the data on its servers. “The breach consisted of unauthorized access to the LetMeSpy website’s database, downloading and at the same time deleting data from the website by the author of the attack,” the notice reads. LetMeSpy’s app no longer functions, a network traffic analysis by TechCrunch shows, and the spyware maker’s website no longer provides the spyware app for download. LetMeSpy was an Android phone monitoring app that was purposefully designed to stay hidden on a victim’s phone home screen, making the app difficult to detect and remove. When planted on a person’s phone — often by someone with knowledge of their phone passcode — apps like LetMeSpy continually steal that person’s messages, call logs and real-time location data. A copy of the database was obtained by nonprofit transparency collective DDoSecrets, which indexes leaked datasets in the public interest, and shared with TechCrunch for analysis. The data showed that LetMeSpy, until recently, had been used to steal data from more than 13,000 compromised Android devices worldwide, though LetMeSpy’s website claimed prior to the breach that it controlled more than 236,000 devices. The database also contained information that shows the spyware was developed by a Krakow-based tech company called Radeal, whose chief executive Rafał Lidwin did not respond to a request for comment. LetMeSpy is the latest spyware operation to shut down in the past year in the wake of a security incident that exposed victims’ data, but also the identities of its real-world operators. SpyTrac, a spyware with more than a million user records in its database, was confirmed to be operated by Support King, a tech company banned from the surveillance industry by federal regulators in 2021 for previously failing to secure stolen data from its then-flagship spyware app, SpyFone. Both SpyTrac and Support King shut down following TechCrunch’s reporting. Read more on TechCrunch: "
2023-08-05,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/05/fearless-fund-american-alliance-equal-rights-lawsuit/,TechCrunch,Here’s what the Fearless Fund lawsuit could mean for venture,"The first official piece of policy around diversity efforts in venture capital may soon see the light of day, but not because of any action by the government. In a complaint filed this week, the American Alliance for Equal Rights — founded by conservative activist Edward Blum, the man driving the effort to end affirmative action — sued a minority-focused venture capital fund for unlawful racial discrimination. In the complaint, the organization accuses Fearless Fund (an early-stage venture capital firm based in Atlanta that focuses on funding solely to women founders of color) of racially discriminating against non-Black individuals by having a $20,000 grant program for only Black women who are small-business owners. The program is the Fearless Strivers Grant Contest, and the fund hosts it four times a year in partnership with Mastercard. The American Alliance for Equal Rights alleges that Fearless Fund is violating Section 1981 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, which states that private contracts must be made and enforced without regard to race. It’s still too early to draw winners and losers in this battle, but if the American Alliance for Equal Rights wins this lawsuit, it could result in the first official piece of law around diversity, equity and inclusion in venture capital. The result could very well set a lasting precedent for how the entire startup ecosystem evolves. And given Blum’s recent record, a loss for Fearless Fund could be on the cards. Gregory Shill, a professor of law at the University of Iowa who teaches a class on the Civil Rights Act as part of his Contracts class, told TechCrunch+ that a victory by Blum and the American Alliance for Equal Rights would stop many of the efforts designed to address the current disparities within venture capital. The Civil Rights Act was the first piece of federal civil rights legislation passed in the U.S., enacted to guarantee that contracts would be honored regardless of race. At the time, it was widely held at the time that the market was open to everyone, but it wasn’t really. “For years, Black founders have complained of discrimination, but they have been effectively blocked from doing anything about it, because, to prevail, they must show that the discrimination is intentional,” he said, adding that many avoid doing so because it can be harmful to their careers. “So rather than challenging this head-on, one alternative tack has been to set up funds that specifically recruit Black or women founders. That effort is what is being challenged here.” Blum told TechCrunch+ that the American Alliance for Equal Rights was contacted by a woman-owned business that asked to help challenge Fearless Fund. “The program being challenged is racially exclusive, thus violating our nation’s civil rights laws. It is to be hoped that other programs like this one end these practices and offer the benefits to all small businesses regardless of the owner’s race,” he said. Fearless Fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  "

He grew up in Jakarta, the son of Korean parents who ran a shipping business. After high school, he headed to Cornell in the U.S. and became an associate at The Carlyle Group. Everything was moving up and to the right, so to speak. Then, like a gut punch, the financial recession hit in 2008. Gwak was among many who suddenly found themselves on uneven footing and evaluating their next steps. Unlike most of his young investing peers, Gwak quickly decided to join the U.S. Marine Corps as a machine gunner. It seemed like a natural decision, given that in Korea, where military service is compulsory for men between ages 18 and 35, both Gwak’s father and brother had served. It was also Gwak’s way of “becoming American,” he says. While he wasn’t expecting his service to end four years later in Afghanistan — he was wounded and sent home — Gwak again didn’t waste much time deliberating about his next moves. He applied and was accepted to Harvard Business School, and nearly since that time, he has been investing at the intersection of national security and technology. Out of school, he joined In-Q-Tel, which is the venture arm of the CIA. In 2017, when the billionaire hedge fund manager “Stevie” Cohen decided to build out a venture practice — Point72 Ventures — he poached Gwak, and Gwak has remained active since, including leading a 50-person team that has invested more than $1 billion into roughly 130 companies on Cohen’s behalf. The deals range across four key areas: deep tech, fintech, enterprise and defense tech. But in a lengthy conversation with Gwak earlier today, he talked the longest about defense tech as he’s passionate about it and because the way he sees it, Washington is focused more than ever on the global balance of power — and looking for any edge it can find. Below are excerpts from that part of our chat, edited lightly for length and clarity. You can listen to the entire conversation here. TC: You have these four areas on which you’re focused, but fintech has cooled off after several frothy years, and defense tech now seems top of mind for investors. Is that true inside Point72? DG: Absolutely. If you rewind the clock, fintech was an area that was very hot and we were very active in deploying a lot of capital. Today, the area that’s really come up is defense tech. It’s not just that the market in general has corrected, but rather, I think defense tech, specifically as an opportunity, has really [gained traction] among other venture investors, as well as founders [along with a growing] awareness of the importance of defense tech to the government. Given your experience over the years, working for and selling to the government, does the sales process move any more quickly than historically? The long-standing knock, of course, is that it’s too bureaucratic and there’s too much red tape to get past. Even five years ago, I would have told you that defense tech investing the way that we think about it — which is investing in companies whose primary customer is going to be the Department of Defense — is a bad idea for exactly the reason that you describe. But that has changed for a couple of big reasons. First of all, the government is generally inefficient at buying things until something comes along that has the potential to shift the global superpower balance, and that’s what you’re seeing today. If you look at the last time that happened, that was probably pursuing the atom bomb and the Manhattan Project. When you look at things like AI and all the ways it applies — whether that’s autonomy or computer vision or natural language processing — these are all things that absolutely can shift the global superpower balance, and the government sees that now. And when the government sees that, then it becomes much, much better at buying things. It seems like a portfolio company of yours, Shield AI, falls into this category. [Editor’s note: Shield AI develops AI-powered fighter pilots and drones that it sells to the U.S. Air Force and U.S Army.] Autonomous drone swarms do have the ability to shift the global superpower balance, whoever gets that right and can release a drone swarm of thousands. That is an approach [against which there are] just not good defenses today, even if you own the largest aircraft carrier fleet in the universe. [And because a company like Shield AI can help in] the future preparedness of America, it can, as a result, get a lot of the funding that comes out of the government. It used to be because of the slower sales cycles and so forth, you had to kind of count on the prize being larger but taking longer to get to. [Today] we’re finally entering a time where, as long as you align with something that really, really matters to the government and you can connect the dots effectively, you can grow that business as quickly as as any commercial business, What has Ukraine meant for its business? Ukraine’s impact on defense tech has been a very catalyzing one. Everyone understood even before Ukraine that drone swarms and the effective use of attributable technologies and things like that could have a very big impact. Ukraine just serves to highlight that in real life. When you look at what’s going on there, that effective use of drones has had a massive impact in that battlefield. So-called slaughterbots are autonomous drones that are programmed to kill people without any human intervention. How does a company like Shield AI deal with potential customers that might misuse its technology? I don’t want to speak on the company’s behalf on that topic because it is a conversation that the company should have with its customers, and I’m not necessarily in those conversations. However, I think the overall topic — the danger posed by autonomy when it comes to taking human beings out of that decision to attack — is a very interesting one. To my mind, it’s all about system design. Any weapon in the world that has a kinetic effect can be very, very dangerous — to the enemy, to ourselves, and to noncombatants who just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.That’s why when you look at all these kinetic systems, there’s always good system design around the decision to take an action, and a human being is usually in the loop. When it comes to this new wave of technology, it’s not like we’re throwing that concept of safety out the window. Good, sound, system design, as informed by the risks that we are willing to  subject ourselves to, is always going to be an important part of the equation. The U.S. government is a big customer that can demand that things are tailored for its purposes. Does it preclude these companies from selling to other governments? How does that work? Do they have to get buy-in from Washington? It depends on what other country we’re talking about [laughs]. To contextualize with numbers, though, the overall spending of the United States and all of its allies on defense is $1.6 trillion. That is a gigantic market. It is an order of magnitude larger than the commercial SaaS market. Of that 1.6 trillion, fully 50% of it is just the U.S. So when you see defense tech companies so focused on the U.S. defense market, there’s a good sound reason for that. That [also] means that if that largest part of the market is asking you not to interact with nations that might be adversarial to the United States, you’re going to respect that. Are the investors interested in these deals changing at all? I know who some of the players are — you, In-Q-Tel, Lux. . . .  Lux is certainly one that’s been investing where deep tech meets defense tech for a while. [There]’s also Founders Fund, 8VC, a16z as part of their American dynamism effort. There is a core group of half a dozen or so that have been focused on defense tech for a while. Now I’m seeing additional investors, tier one venture investors, who were not necessarily historically interested in defense tech, start to be a lot more interested. That’s a good thing. The opportunity is just so large. If you think about it, the DoD has an $800 billion budget and only 1% of that today goes to startups. That’s an incredible stat. I guess I have the headline to this story now. Who gets the rest? Lockheed Martin? It’s largely the defense primes today, which serve an important purpose. But the truly transformational technologies that the DoD needs to be able to harness in the next 10 years, those are going to come from startups."

The reallocation and layoffs are expected to delay testing of the under-development Rocket 4 and Launch System 2.0, Astra said. The affected employees worked in the company’s launch, sales and administration and “shared services” departments. Workforce reductions are expected to save the company more than $4 million per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. Astra, which is facing dwindling cash reserves, is no doubt looking for a way to further reduce operating expenses while also bolstering its spacecraft engine business, the only business unit that currently has a near-term chance of generating revenue. The spacecraft engine technology is sourced from Astra’s acquisition of propulsion developer Apollo Fusion, which closed the day Astra went public in July 2021. Indeed, Astra said that it had closed 278 committed orders of the Astra Spacecraft Engine product through the end of March, which totals around $77 million in contracts once the engines are delivered. A “substantial majority” of these orders will be delivered through the end of 2024, the company said. “We are intensely focused on delivering on our commitments to our customers, which includes ensuring we have sufficient resources and an adequate financial runway to execute on our near-term opportunities,” Chris Kemp, CEO and founder, said in a statement. Astra also said that it had engaged investment bank PJT Partners as a financial advisor as it looks for more capital to continue operations. That includes “potential strategic investments in the Astra Spacecraft Engine business to strengthen Astra’s balance sheet,” the company said. Separately, Astra said it had raised $10.8 million in a debt sale to investment group High Trail Capital. According to preliminary second-quarter financial results, Astra is expected to have revenues between $0.5-$1 million, while having just $26-$26.5 million in cash on hand. This is not the first time major layoffs have hit the space company. Last November, Astra announced it had let go of 16% of its employees, also to focus on launch and spacecraft engines."

They promised to hand out gift cards, gaming PC equipment and PlayStation 5s. But the IRL stream descended into chaos as frenzied fans crowded over the giveaway, shutting down lower Manhattan in the aftermath. Cenat, who has 6.5 million Twitch followers and 4 million YouTube subscribers, advertised the New York City giveaway in now-deleted tweets. He collaborated with Fanum, who has 1.3 million followers on Twitch and 1.2 million on YouTube. The stream was scheduled for 4:00 p.m. on Friday. But by 1:10 pm, police responded to a “large gathering” in the park, a New York Police Department spokesperson told TechCrunch. The spokesperson said that “a couple thousand individuals” crowded into the location. By 3:30, videos of the riot began flooding social media. Fights broke out as people in the crowd climbed vehicles and threw traffic cones. Cenat’s stream was cut short. A clip on his Twitch channel shows the crowd shoving into each other. The NYPD spokesperson said about 1,000 police officers were deployed to the location, and at the time of reporting, there were no injuries. Cenat was pulled from the crowd and taken into police custody, NBC New York reports, but the NYPD spokesperson could not confirm additional arrests to TechCrunch. That “may change,” the spokesperson said, as the NYPD will not have “concrete numbers” until this evening or tomorrow morning. Videos posted online claim that other creators were also arrested during the riot. Cenat briefly went live on Instagram from inside a police car, and told the crowd to go home. The NYPD advised New Yorkers to steer clear of Union Square Park and the surrounding neighborhoods. “Expect a police presence in the area and residual traffic delays,” the department said in a tweet. Public transit was also significantly delayed. The New York Transit Authority announced that eight subway lines will bypass the Union Square stop because of police activity, and urged commuters to take alternate routes. Cenat posted, and then deleted, a message to his followers in the aftermath of the riot. “I love you guys to the fullest, you guys are amazing,” he wrote in a now-deleted Instagram story, which featured a photo of local news coverage of the riot. “THE LOVE FROM HOME BASE IS REAL. Please be safe.”"
2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/pony-investor-toyota-partner-to-mass-produce-robotaxis-in-china/,TechCrunch,"Pony, investor Toyota partner to ‘mass produce’ robotaxis in China","Autonomous-driving company Pony.ai and Toyota say they’re teaming up with the goal of one day cranking out a bunch of “fully driverless robotaxis.” The two companies intend to kick off their partnership sometime this year with around $139 million in capital from GAC Toyota Motor Co. — a joint venture between Toyota China and GAC, a Chinese state-owned automaker. The investment follows Toyota’s move to pump about $400 million into Pony back in 2020. Going forward, Toyota says it’ll give Pony an unspecified number of its EVs, while Pony will outfit them with autonomous-driving tech and the firm’s “robotaxi network platform.”  Without context, $139 million may sound like a lot, but Pony has raised more than a billion dollars since its founding in 2016. Things arguably haven’t gone smoothly throughout the self-driving developer’s lifetime. In 2021, Pony kicked off driverless-vehicle testing in California, only to see its permit suspended six months later. The same year, the company seemed to shrink its autonomous trucking ambitions when it consolidated its R&D teams and shed a couple executives. The next year, Pony recalled its autonomous-driving software and sued two former staffers for allegedly swiping trade secrets when they left to found a startup called Qingtian Truck. Yet, around the same time, Pony claimed to be worth $8.5 billion (and that’s the last we’ve heard of its valuation to date). Pony isn’t alone in its trials. The entire autonomous vehicle industry, once a darling in the VC world, has gone through a consolidation that has seen numerous startups wither and disappear, particularly in the United States. The few that remain — a small group of well-funded companies that are either publicly traded or owned by large corporations — are starting to scale up commercial operations, albeit slower than perhaps originally forecast. "
2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/softbank-sues-irl-over-elaborate-scheme-that-swallowed-150m/,TechCrunch,SoftBank sues IRL over ‘elaborate scheme’ that swallowed $150M,"SoftBank once invested in social app IRL at a $1.1 billion valuation. Now, the Japanese investment firm is suing the defunct company for fraud, alleging $150 million in damages. IRL was supposedly poised to become an event organizing alternative for Gen Z, who are using Facebook less and less. Its self-reported numbers were impressive enough to solicit a $170 million Series C led by SoftBank in 2021, but earlier this summer, an internal investigation by IRL’s board of directors found that 95% of the app’s users were fake. In its legal complaint, SoftBank explains that it was moved to invest in IRL because of its impressive user numbers; the app claimed it had been downloaded by 25% of U.S. teens under 28 years old and was growing at a 400% year-over-year rate. But per the IRL board’s investigation, none of these figures were accurate. Investors don’t always do their due diligence, but SoftBank claims it wouldn’t have been possible to verify IRL’s fake user numbers, since it had “prepared for SoftBank’s due diligence and structured IRL’s business so that SoftBank could not discover evidence of their fraud.” SoftBank explains in detail its attempts at conducting due diligence before forking over a nine-figure sum. Per SoftBank’s claims, IRL was spending tens of thousands of dollars on proxy services to fraudulently inflate IRL’s user data with bots. SoftBank also accused IRL of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars per month to a secret firm operated by IRL’s head of Growth to cover up this scheme. “Because IRL did not have any profitable revenue stream, its value to an outside investor like SoftBank depended on its active user metrics as a source of potential future income,” SoftBank’s complaint reads. “Thus, SoftBank relied on the accuracy of representations from IRL’s executives concerning both the quantity and quality of IRL’s users.” Reached via text, IRL CEO Abraham Shafi did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Shafi is named as a defendant in the complaint, as are five of his siblings and cousins, who SoftBank alleges were part of this cover-up. Each of these family members sold IRL common stock to SoftBank in connection with these investments. When SoftBank accessed a third-party report on IRL’s total users and downloads, the data said that by spring 2021, IRL had only been downloaded 9 million times. Shafi, on the other hand, was claiming that the app had 12 million monthly active users, and that 2 million events got planned each day on IRL. Shafi explained away this discrepancy by saying that the number accounted neither for web sessions, nor underage users, whose data could not be shared. “In reality, the platform was a virtual ghost town, filled with bots deceptively mimicking active human users,” SoftBank wrote. In addition to this lawsuit, IRL is being probed by the SEC to determine whether the app violated security laws by misleading investors. "
2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/hate-your-commute-googlers-can-sleep-on-campus-at-a-discount/,TechCrunch,Hate your commute? Googlers can sleep on campus at a discount,"The pandemic disrupted the office in a fundamental way. Remote work turned from a nice perk to a way of life for many. It’s an abrupt change for a tech industry that has a long history of rolling out perks to keep employees in the office for as long as conceivably possible. Google is among those corporations that has been pulling out all the stops to get Googler butts back into their Herman Miller Aerons. But a new perk is rubbing some employees the wrong way. The company is internally advertising a $99 “Summer Special” for its campus hotel. Granted, as someone who frequently books lodging in the South Bay, that’s quite a deal, but the whole bit about effectively sleeping at the office leaves a bit to be desired. “Just imagine no commute to the office in the morning and instead, you could have an extra hour of sleep and less friction,” the company writes. “Next, you could walk out of your room and quickly grab a delicious breakfast or get a workout in before work starts.” The “deal,” which runs through the end of September, is for full-time employees only. It doesn’t qualify as a travel expense, so employees have to pay for it themselves, using their personal credit cards.

2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/henrik-fisker-no-final-conclusion-yet-in-foxconn-deal/,TechCrunch,Henrik Fisker: No ‘final conclusion’ yet in Foxconn deal,"Two years ago, EV startup Fisker seemed to have hooked a giant when it announced a deal with Taiwanese iPhone maker Foxconn to build a sub-$30,000 crossover in the United States. It turns out that deal hasn’t been finalized, according to comments Fisker founder and CEO Henrik Fisker made during an interview with TechCrunch. “In the Foxconn deal specifically, we don’t yet have a final conclusion to this deal,” Fisker told TechCrunch on the sidelines of an event in Huntington Beach, California, to showcase its future EV portfolio. While Henrik Fisker is still confident it will come together, his comments show just how precarious and complex automotive manufacturing deals can be. And considering Foxconn’s history of backing out of other factory agreements, there’s reason for some caution. Foxconn and Fisker signed in February 2021 a memorandum of understanding agreement, with the goal of producing 250,000 vehicles annually. While it wasn’t clear which vehicle Fisker might build with Foxconn, the automaker had said that it was working on the Personal Automotive Electric Revolution (PEAR) — an EV built for cities and urban environments that would cost less than $30,000. The Fisker-Foxconn deal came together relatively quickly following the announcement of the memorandum, and by May 2021, Foxconn and Fisker had a signed agreement, setting those expectations in writing. A few months later, Foxconn made a separate deal with EV maker Lordstown Motors that included buying its factory in Ohio and helping the struggling company manufacture its Endurance electric pickup truck. Fisker became a beneficiary of the deal when, in May 2022, the company announced it reached an agreement with Foxconn to build its PEAR EV at the Lordstown factory. But cracks soon formed in Foxconn’s agreement with Lordstown Motors. Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy and has sued Foxconn for “fraudulent conduct,” stating that the Taiwanese company had made a litany of “broken promises.” Foxconn currently still owns the manufacturing plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and Fisker says that plans to build the PEAR in the Lordstown plant are still on track. Foxconn is no stranger to scuttling done deals. The company withdrew from a $19.5 billion agreement with Indian company Vedanta last month. It also famously received a $3 billion incentives package to build a factory in Wisconsin that was supposed to create 13,000 jobs. The state ended up reducing incentives when Foxconn failed to deliver on its initial promises. Image Credits: Abigail Bassett Fisker still appears bullish on its PEAR vehicle and the prospects of finalizing its deal with Foxconn. On Thursday, Fisker revealed a finalized prototype of the PEAR, and executives said the company wants to eventually build up to 1 million PEAR vehicles, per year, at plants around the world, including those in the U.S., Europe, China and India. The company is even taking preorders for the Fisker PEAR. According to a Fisker spokesperson, the ongoing suit between Foxconn and Lordstown Motors won’t prevent Fisker from building the PEAR in the Foxconn Lordstown plant at this point. “For the PEAR, because we have this reduction of parts in the vehicle, we also need to change the assembly line slightly,” Henrik Fisker told TechCrunch. “The line is a different type of assembly, and the good news is that Foxconn doesn’t have much in that plant. So we need to set all this up. So that’s the discussion that’s going on.” However, Henrik Fisker told TechCrunch there are some outstanding questions that both Foxconn and Fisker need to resolve. “Part of it is that both parties want a lot more information,” Fisker said in an interview with TechCrunch. “So we need a little more information for some suppliers because, don’t forget, once you have a deal, somebody’s saying, that’s how much it costs to assemble it, and we’re saying okay, we agreed to that, right? So we’re still working on exchanging information and getting to, “This is how we’re going to do it,” Fisker continued. It’s important to note that no other automaker has successfully created a sub-$30,000 EV yet. GM tried with the $26,595 Bolt but reportedly lost a considerable amount of money on every Bolt sold. Hyundai has a couple of affordable EVs in their lineup, including the Ioniq 5 and 6, but both start in the mid-$40,000 range. Tesla killed off its never-existent sub-$30,000 Model S in 2022. Fisker has priced the PEAR at $29,900 before incentives and tax rebates. After incentives, the price drops to $22,400, according to the company. That’s a goal fraught with potential cost overruns, including locking in suppliers and retooling manufacturing plants. The company said it has cut the cost of manufacturing the PEAR by using an internal development process that helped it reduce the number of parts needed in the vehicles by 35%. Fisker said it will also save money by building its own supercomputers for the vehicles and by making the PEAR easier and faster to assemble. Henrik Fisker confirmed Friday during the company’s Q2 earnings call that the Foxconn deal was not yet completely buttoned up. “The PEAR will be built here, [in the U.S.], but we are still in final talks with Foxconn. When you deal with contract manufacturing, it’s a little different because you have to go through all the details of each vehicle to understand the exact cost of assembly,” he said on the call. Later in the call, Fisker said that he expects the deal to be finalized in the next three months. Fisker also noted that overnight, the company took in around 1,000 orders for the new Alaska pickup, which will be built and sold in the U.S. “The chance for us is let’s get these cars to market as fast as we can. Grab as much market share, because once you grab market share, you have a much bigger chance to hold on to it,” Fisker told TechCrunch. “Nobody can make a car in two years, now. We started all these programs two years ago. So they’ve all been under development and kind of in skunk works, so they’re all ready to go. Ready to go to suppliers and get into production,” he continued. “We still have to select certain manufacturing sites, and we’re in the middle of all that. But the strategy is really let’s get great product to market, really innovative product that excites people and let’s take a big market share.”"
2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/sec-ends-investigation-into-better-com-which-is-bleeding-cash-ahead-of-planned-spac-vote/,TechCrunch,"SEC ends investigation into Better.com, which continues to bleed cash ahead of planned SPAC vote","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action against digital mortgage lender Better.com. The pronouncement comes after an investigation on the part of the SEC to determine if violations of federal securities laws had occurred. Last July, the SEC began looking into whether Better.com had violated federal securities laws, requesting documents from both the company and SPAC partner Aurora Acquisition Corp. about their business activities.  Regulators sought information about the business activities of CEO and co-founder Vishal Garg and allegations made by Sarah Pierce, former executive vice president of customer experience, sales and operations, who claimed that Better.com had misrepresented the health of its business in order to move forward with a SPAC.  In an August 3 statement, the SEC also noted that while it does not recommend an enforcement action, the decision “must in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff’s investigation.” Meanwhile, the long-awaited vote for Better.com to go public is scheduled for August 11 ahead of the extended deadline to complete the merger deal on September 30. The company originally began making plans to go public via a $6 billion SPAC in May 2021. Things took a dramatic turn for the worse later that year, and the SPAC was delayed. In late July, Aurora said in an SEC filing that shareholders would be asked to vote on a proposal that if the SPAC did take place, with Aurora surviving the merger, that Aurora would change its name to “Better Home & Finance Holding Company,” It added: “If Aurora is unable to complete the merger with Better.com by the extended deadline of September 30 and is not able to complete another business combination by the specified date, Aurora will cease all operations within 10 business days except for the purpose of winding up.” Last year, Better.com declared that it intended to move forward with its planned public debut, despite lackluster performance of blank-check combinations in previous quarters. Better.com itself had seen its fair share of turbulence since it announced its plans to merge with a SPAC, including multiple botched layoffs (more on those here and here) and changing market conditions that impacted parts of its business, including a surge in mortgage interest rates. A company spokesperson told TechCrunch Friday that Better.com is still in a quiet period given the SPAC so it “cannot comment publicly.” More recently, in June, Better.com announced it was exiting the real estate business. The embattled fintech startup laid off its real estate team on June 7, shifting from an in-house agent model to a partnership agent model. It also continues to bleed cash. According to HousingWire, other Aurora filings from July showed that Better.com had posted a net loss of $89.9 million in Q1 2023 and had slashed about 91% of its workforce over an approximately 18-month period. Specifically, as reported by HousingWire, the company had about 950 employees as of June 8 compared with a peak of about 10,400 employees in the fourth quarter of 2021. While Better.com seems to have narrowed its loss compared to a net loss of $327.7 million in the first quarter of 2022, it’s clearly still struggling. Want more fintech news in your inbox?

On the bright-ish side, research shows that 69% of Americans want our nation to become carbon neutral by 2050. Achieving that goal will require changing the way we think and act about sustainability. But, when push comes to shoveling food into our faces, how far are we willing to go? Will we make room on our plates for lab-cultured meat or pour frosty mugs of genetically modified beer? And will shifts such as these meaningfully help us avoid worst-case climate scenarios? These are just a few of the questions we can’t wait to digest when Charles Denby, co-founder and CEO of Berkeley Yeast, and Matthew Walker, managing director of food and agriculture at S2G Ventures, join us for a session called “Beer, Lab Meat and Climate Chaos.” You’ll find it cooking on the Sustainability Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, which runs September 19–21 in San Francisco. Denby’s Berkeley Yeast focuses on genetically modifying yeasts to imbue beer with a range of different flavor notes. One such yeast produces hoppy-tasting beer without hops, a crop that requires a lot of energy and water throughout the growing and drying process. Can the company find ways to slash emissions from other fermented products? And Walker sits on the board of Believer (formerly Future Meat Technologies), which focuses on lab-grown chicken; Greenlight, a firm applying RNA tech to agriculture; and Hazel, which focuses on boosting the shelf life of produce. We have the technology to make foods and beverages more sustainable. But do enough people want to try them, and can we scale them to wide availability, affordability and profitability? And, more broadly, who’s working on limiting the environmental toll of other ubiquitous foods and drinks? Can we really preserve beer, meat and other cultural touchstones — like coffee and wine — while mitigating climate chaos? Don’t miss what promises to be an insightful conversation on the future of sustainable food and drink. Learn more about our speakers — and their qualifications for tackling this tasty topic — below. Charles Denby is a scientist turned entrepreneur. Working under UC Berkeley professor and renowned metabolic engineering pioneer Dr. Jay Keasling, Denby spent his early scientific career bioengineering yeast to produce next-gen biofuels (e.g., clean diesel). His career path, however, was redrawn by a hobby. While exploring home brewing as a way to engage his passion for beer, Denby saw how the same technology used for making biofuels could be applied to the production of beer and wine, making them more consistent, efficient and less reliant on resource-intensive agricultural products such as hops and fruit. In 2017, he co-founded Berkeley Yeast to commercialize this technology and its transformative benefits. Today, the company sells bioengineered yeast with extraordinary capabilities to hundreds of breweries and wineries across the country. Matthew Walker has more than 10 years of experience in venture capital, investment banking and securities law. At S2G, Walker focuses on making investments, managing portfolio companies and serving on various portfolio company boards. Before joining S2G, Walker was an investment banking associate at Perella Weinberg Partners in New York, where he focused on M&A and restructuring transactions across a range of industries. Prior to that role, he served as a securities attorney in the funds, regulation and equity derivatives practice at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, LLP in New York. Walker has an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, a JD from New York University School of Law, and a BS in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan.

2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/unpacking-the-end-of-lukos-solo-journey-in-insurtech/,TechCrunch,Unpacking the end of Luko’s solo journey in insurtech,"European insurtech is showing strength that you can’t spot if you only read the data on venture capital that’s available today. Indeed, some startups are showing strong fundamentals that will likely help them through this volatile landscape and then some. We made this point a couple weeks ago and we still stand by it. However, it’s not all rosy for companies that put growth first back when it was sexy to reach for the skies and now find themselves in a market that favors a quick, viable and visible path to profitability. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Case in point: French insurtech Luko, which neared insolvency before agreeing to be acquired by British insurer Admiral Group. The deal itself makes a lot of sense, but the rumored price tag — €11 million plus an additional €3 million tied to specific milestones — is raising eyebrows. That’s because Luko had previously raised €72 million in total, aiming to build a European leader in insurtech. Starting with digital home insurance, the company quickly set out to pursue its goal of achieving European insurtech dominance by offering a speedy onboarding process, a better customer experience than incumbents, and other nifty features. It even acquired two startups: Coya, a German company licensed as an insurer, and Unkle, a French company protecting landlords against unpaid rent. But things didn’t turn out as well as Luko hoped. Unkle’s founder is suing Luko following his dismissal from the company after the deal, and according to reports, Admiral isn’t buying the two startups as part of its own deal. And, due to the structure of the acquisitions, Unkle’s investors might not see a dime from its €22 million takeover. Neither Luko nor Admiral commented on the specifics or financial aspects of the deal, which is still being finalized. But they were willing to talk to TechCrunch+ about the fit between the two organizations, and to touch on some of the reasons that stopped Luko from fulfilling its journey on its own. It’s the latter that we’ll explore today, with additional insights from insurtech experts. There’s quite a bit of spin to sift through in the LinkedIn post that Luko’s CEO, Raphaël Vullierme, wrote about the company’s sale to Admiral. It’s a “huge achievement,” he writes, but if you look deeper, the post also has various insights about the insurtech market and the struggles that startups have to face. “Winning in this market requires time and money: it takes eight to ten years and €100-€150M to build a sustainably profitable B2C insurer in the P&C space,” Vullierme wrote. [P&C stands for property and casualty, the type of insurance that protects people and their belongings.] "
2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/capellas-earth-imaging-satellites-are-deorbiting-faster-than-expected/,TechCrunch,Capella’s Earth-imaging satellites are deorbiting faster than expected,"Update: The story has been updated to include comments from Capella Space CEO Payam Banazadeh and Phase Four. Paragraph five and six have been updated with additional context on solar flair activity and premature satellite reentry, and paragraph eleven contains additional information on Phase Four technology.  Capella Space’s synthetic aperture radar satellites are falling back to Earth much sooner than the three years they were anticipated to operate, according to publicly available satellite data. The startup has launched a total of ten small satellites to low Earth orbit since 2018, including eight in its family of “Whitney”-class spacecraft. Five of these satellites have reentered the atmosphere since the end of January of this year, including three of the Whitneys. Those Whitney sats were in orbit for less than two-and-a-half years; one, Capella-5, was in orbit for less than two years. That leaves five of the constellation in orbit, including the Capella-9 and Capella-10 launched on March 16, which are operating at an altitude of around 584 km and 588 km, respectively. According to filings with the Federal Communication Commission, the propulsion system of Capella-9 was built by Phase Four. At least one of the satellites that has reentered prematurely, Capella-5, also used Phase Four propulsion. In that same filing from March 2022, Capella said its Capella-9 satellite would operate at an orbital altitude of 525 km, and maintain an altitude between 475-575 km for three years. It seems this is the typical mission profile of Capella satellites. But Capella-7 and Capella-8, launched in January 2022, appear to be now operating below 400 kilometers, and will likely deorbit in a matter of weeks to a few months. The unexpected decay could be due to a problem with the propulsion system, a systematic miscalculation of its requirements, or other issues with the satellite performance unrelated to propulsion. Solar activity in the Earth’s atmosphere has also ramped up; so-called ‘space weather’ can create issues for satellites, due to the increased atmospheric density and a higher number of solar events, like geomagnetic storms. According to NASA, we are ramping up to solar maximum, or the time in the solar cycle when sun’s activity peaks, which could take place in 2024 or 2025 (the full solar cycle began in 2019 and is anticipated to last through 2030). In general, this isn’t good for spacecraft; for example, in February 2022, SpaceX lost 40 Starlink satellites in one fell swoop due to a geomagnetic storm. “The amount of solar activity in this new solar cycle is higher than anyone anticipated and atmospheric drag is affecting all LEO constellations,” said Steve Kiser, Phase Four board member, speaking on behalf of the company. “Phase Four and Capella Space enjoys a collaborative and cooperative partnership and we will continue to engage on how best to support their very important Earth Observation mission.”  “Probably they [Capella-7 and Capella-8] will reenter in Sep-Oct or so,” astronomer and analyst Jonathan McDowell said when reviewing the data at TechCrunch’s request. “I suspect propulsion failures but certainly it isn’t clear.” In a statement to TechCrunch, Capella CEO Payam Banazadeh confirmed that some of the satellites have been deorbiting faster than expected “due to the combination of increased drag due to much higher solar activity than predicted by NOAA and less than expected performance from our 3rd party propulsion system.” “We have upgraded our propulsion system on all future satellites to account for these facts, including the launch of our next generation satellite Acadia-1, currently scheduled for launch on August 5th 2023. We plan to launch eight of our next generation Acadia satellites over the next 12 months,” he added. Late last month, Aviation Week reported that Phase Four has developed and tested a next-gen radio-frequency thruster for spacecraft that has hit performance parity or greater with a typical Hall-effect thruster, at decreased cost. It is unclear whether that thruster, which is called Maxwell Block 3, is the thruster that will be used on Capella’s Acadia satellites. TechCrunch has sent the inquiry to Banazadeh and will update the story with his response. Seven year old Capella is one of a handful of startups building out constellations of synthetic aperture radar satellites in low Earth orbit, an imaging technique that allows for detailed 3D scans of the surface regardless of weather. In January, the company raised $60 million in funding, less than nine months after it closed a $97 million Series C. At the time, the company said the new capital would be used to build and launch the Acadia sats. The first Acadia satellite will launch on board a Rocket Lab Electron rocket on August 6, the first of a multi-mission contract the two firms signed in February. An independent report on orbital debris remediation prepared by NASA estimated each Capella satellite cost $5 million."

State-sponsored bad actors have long been able to make “deepfake” videos that are good enough to trick unsophisticated viewers — and probably some more clued-in folks, too. That sort of work takes significant processing power and technical know-how to pull off. Now AI is stepping in, handing over an unlabeled glass bottle, muttering, “Hold my beer,” and cracking its proverbial knuckles. Things that we could barely dream of at the beginning of 2023 are beginning to be possible when it comes to generated video AI. Of course, with great power comes great responsibility, but tell that to the memelords doin’ it for the lolz. Personally (and, perhaps, perversely), I think it’s a great thing that these technologies are making their way into everyone’s hands. Special effects have been a strange, mythical “other” that Hollywood does. Generated AI selfies were a rage for a hot minute (is anyone still using Lensa?) and did wonders in educating people on what is possible. It’s not that I’m excited about this tech being universally available, but (contrary to what these curmudgeonly pieces would indicate), I’m an optimist at heart. Perhaps exposing people to what’s possible will help give even non-tech-savvy folks a fighting chance at spotting fake videos. I suppose it is only optimism if it’s from the optimisme region of France. Maybe what I’m experiencing is lightly sparking hope. Image Credits: Getty Images Over the past few weeks, I’ve done a lot of writing about fundraising for startup founders. In a conversation with a VC this week, I told them that I had a flags-based checklist for evaluating pitch decks (e.g., “red flag” means that you haven’t a whelk’s chance in a supernova to raise funding. I haven’t figured out if there should be a mauve flag, nor what it would mean). It inspired me to share where founders go wrong when fundraising (TC+). Yes, it means I’m showing the world everything I care about in a pitch deck, but, I mean, 100+ articles about pitching and fundraising later, I think that cat was well and truly out of the bag anyway. You know what early-stage founders really hate? Putting together their traction slide. What do you put when you’re straddling that pre-product/pre-revenue line? I had a bit of an epiphany when I was working with one of my pitch clients: Your traction slide, abstractly, is how much risk you have designed out of the business. Tell that story, and you end up with a reasonable traction narrative, even if it isn’t directly tied to revenue. Apropos fundraising, there’s been a fair bit of activity on that front: It’s a nice Jobs if you can get it: Apple founder Steve Jobs met his demise from cancer. Now his son, Reed Jobs, takes the wraps off a $200 million venture fund that will back new cancer treatments. iForgot: Backed by a16z, Rewind launches an iPhone app to help you remember everything.

Two extremely experienced lawyers talk about the cavalcade of cluster-copulation that’s happening in the legal system. Rather compelling. Closer to home, in startup land, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been accused of being toothless, but it truly has had enough of one company’s BS, fining a robocaller a record $300 million after blocking billions of their scam calls.

2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/ai-chip-startup-tenstorrent-lands-100m-investment-from-hyundai-and-samsung/,TechCrunch,AI chip startup Tenstorrent lands $100M investment from Hyundai and Samsung,"The appetite for hardware to train AI models is voracious. AI chips are forecast to account for up to 20% of the $450 billion total semiconductor market by 2025, according to McKinsey. And The Insight Partners projects that sales of AI chips will climb to $83.3 billion in 2027 from $5.7 billion in 2018, a compound annual growth rate 35%. (That’s close to 10 times the forecast growth rate for non-AI chips.) Case in point, Tenstorrent, the AI hardware startup helmed by engineering luminary Jim Keller, this week announced that it raised $100 million in a convertible note funding round co-led by Hyundai Motor Group and Samsung Catalyst Fund. Indeed, $50 million of the total came from Hyundai’s two car-making units, Hyundai Motor ($30 million) and Kia ($20 million), which plan to partner with Tenstorrent to jointly develop chips, specifically CPUs and AI co-processors, for future mobility vehicles and robots. Samsung Catalyst and other VC funds, including Fidelity Ventures, Eclipse Ventures, Epiq Capital and Maverick Capital, contributed the remaining $50 million. Unlike equity, a convertible note is short-term debt that converts to equity upon some predetermined event. Why Tenstorrent opted for debt over equity isn’t entirely clear — nor is the company’s post-money valuation. (Tenstorrent described it as an “up-round” in a release.) Tenstorrent last raised $200 million at a valuation eclipsing $2 billion. The convertible note tranche, which had participation from Fidelity Ventures, Eclipse Ventures, Epiq Capital, Maverick Capital and more, brings Tenstorrent’s total raised to $334.5 million. Keller says it’ll be put toward product development, the design and development of AI chiplets and Tenstorrent’s machine learning software roadmap. Toronto-based Tenstorrent sells AI processors and licenses AI software solutions and IP around RISC-V, the open source instruction set architecture used to develop custom processors for a range of applications.

In 2020, Tenstorrent announced Grayskull, an all-in-one system designed to accelerate AI model training in data centers, public and private clouds, on-premises servers and edge servers, featuring Tenstorrent’s proprietary Tensix cores. But in the intervening years, perhaps feeling the pressure from incumbents like Nvidia, Tenstorrent shifted its focus to licensing and services and Bajic, once at the helm, slowly transitioned to an advisory role. In 2021, Tenstorrent launched DevCloud, a cloud-based service that lets developers run AI models without first having to purchase hardware. And, more recently, the company established partnerships with India-based server system builder Bodhi Computing and LG to build Tenstorrent’s products into the former’s servers and the latter’s automotive products and TVs. (As a part of the LG deal, Tenstorrent said it would work with LG to deliver improved video processing in Tenstorrent’s upcoming data center products.) Tenstorrent — nothing if not ambitious — opened a Tokyo office in March to expand beyond its offices in Toronto as well as Austin and Silicon Valley. The question is whether it compete against the other heavyweights in the AI chip race. Google created a processor, the TPU (short for “tensor processing unit”), to train large generative AI systems like PaLM-2 and Imagen. Amazon offers proprietary chips to AWS customers both for training (Trainium) and inferencing (Inferentia). And Microsoft, reportedly, is working with AMD to develop an in-house AI chip called Athena. Nvidia, meanwhile, briefly became a $1 trillion company this year, riding high on the demand for its GPUs for AI training. (As of Q2 2022, Nvidia retained an 80% share of the discrete GPU market.) GPUs, while not necessarily as capable as custom-designed AI chips, have the ability to perform many computations in parallel, making them well-suited to training the most sophisticated models today. It’s been a tough environment for startups and even tech giants, unsurprisingly. Last year, AI chipmaker Graphcore, which reportedly had its valuation slashed by $1 billion after a deal with Microsoft fell through, said that it was planning job cuts due to the “extremely challenging” macroeconomic environment. Meanwhile, Habana Labs, the Intel-owned AI chip company, laid off an estimated 10% of its workforce. Complicating matters is a shortage in the components necessary to build AI chips. Time will tell, as it always does, which vendors come out on top."

The new merchandise featured on Bandsintown is from the Amazon Music Artist Merch Shop that launched in 2021. The centralized hub offers apparel, CDs, vinyl, accessories and more from top artists such as Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Adele, Blackpink, Luke Combs, Justin Bieber and Doja Cat, among others. Amazon Music recently collaborated with artists Fall Out Boy and Beyoncé, who will both have their exclusive merch collections available on their Bandsintown profile pages. Fans can shop items for Fall Out Boy’s So Much For (Tour) Dust tour and Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour. Image Credits: Bandsintown/Amazon Music The merch integration is available for artists registered with Bandsintown for Artists, Bandsintown’s platform that gives artists access to marketing tools and lets them promote merch drops, new albums and live events through in-app notifications, email and social media. The collaboration comes as concert tickets continue to skyrocket. The average price of a concert ticket on SeatGeek has doubled in the past five years, jumping from $125 in 2019 to $252 in 2023, per The Wall Street Journal. Merch is not only a crucial revenue stream for artists, but it’s also a more affordable way for fans to show their support. “Merch is an opportunity to demonstrate fandom and a critical source of revenue at times when touring costs are rising,” said Fabrice Sergent, Bandsintown co-founder and managing partner, in a press release. “We’re proud to come together with Amazon Music to further our mutual goals of helping artists and their fans.” Bandsintown has 80 million registered users."

When it comes to extending cash on hand, everything from canceling subscriptions to “a hard pivot” must be on the table, says Ben Boissevain, founder of Ascento Capital. “If a company has a limited runway, pursue multiple corporate finance options simultaneously.

2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/nikola-ceo-steps-down-replaced-by-chairman/,TechCrunch,"Nikola CEO steps down, replaced by chairman","EV truck maker Nikola Corp. said Friday that president/CEO Michael Lohscheller is leaving the top executive positions due to a family health issue. He will be replaced by board chairman Steve Girsky, a former GM board member and the CEO of the special purpose acquisition company that merged with Nikola to make it a publicly company. Lohscheller has decided to step down due to a family health matter and will be returning to Europe, the company said in a statement. He will remain at Nikola in an advisory capacity through the end of September, according to Nikola. “The Board respects Michael’s decision to be with his family during this time and thanks him for his hard work, dedication, and contributions to Nikola,” Girsky said in a statement. “I am grateful for all that Michael was able to accomplish to move our company forward during his tenure.” Lohscheller joined Nikola as president in March 2022. Just months later, the company announced he would take the CEO spot from Mark Russell who officially retired in January 2023. Prior to joining Nikola, Lohscheller was CEO of Opel and VinFast, as well as CFO at Volkswagen Group of America and Mitsubishi Motors Europe. The CEO news coupled with the company’s second-quarter earnings report, which was released Friday, sent shares down more than 12%. Shares were trading at $2.98 as of midday Friday. Nikola reported revenue of $15.4 million in the second quarter, a 15% drop from the same period last year. Nikola’s losses also grew from a year ago. The company reported a loss of $217.8 million compared to a loss of $173 million in same year-ago period. Still, Lohscheller tried to take a positive tone in earnings, saying the company had “turned the corner” and is well on the way to executing its business plan and achieving profitability. Nikola has experienced a string of scandals and internal dramas over the past several years, largely due to its controversial and since ousted founder Trevor Milton, who was charged with wire and securities fraud. In recent years, Girsky, the board and Lohscheller have tried to put Nikola back on the right and less scandalous path and one focused on producing its battery-electric truck and launching its Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell electric truck. On Thursday, the company successfully received enough shareholder support to issue more shares, a move that would allow it to potentially raise more capital."
2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/spotify-introduces-new-product-to-help-software-development-teams-with-with-a-b-testing/,TechCrunch,Spotify introduces new product to help software development teams with A/B testing,"Spotify is introducing a new commercial product for software development teams called “Confidence,” which is based on its homegrown experimentation platform. Confidence is designed to make it easy for teams to set up, run, coordinate and analyze their own user tests so they can quickly optimize their ideas. Confidence is currently only available as a private beta. “Spotify’s data scientists and engineers have been developing and honing our product testing methods for years,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Whether it’s automatically coordinating simultaneous A/B tests or orchestrating the rollout of an AI recommendation system across mobile, desktop, and web, the platform we built scales experimentation best practices and capabilities to all our teams. Soon this experimentation platform will be available to any company that wants to build, test, and iterate ideas the way we do at Spotify: quickly, reliably, and with confidence.” Spotify says Confidence is designed to help software development teams whether they have outgrown their current testing platform or are looking for a quick and easy way to get started with A/B testing. The music streaming service says its experimentation efforts began in the early 2010s when a few data scientists and engineers started conducting small A/B tests internally. Although these tests were manual and error-prone, Spotify understood the importance of experimenting and wanted to get better at it. The company then decided to build its own basic A/B testing platform, which it called ABBA. The platform did feature flagging and analysis for a set of standardized metrics. Spotify says this unlocked a wave of experimentation across the company, and that it grew from running fewer than 20 priority experiments per year to running hundreds of experiments per year across multiple squads. Confidence will be available to customers in three ways. First, it can be run as a managed service, which means you can access the experimentation platform as a standalone web service managed by Spotify. Second, you can run it as a Backstage plugin. Last, you can integrate the Confidence platform into your own infrastructure via APIs. Software development teams can now sign up for the waitlist to be eligible for an invite to Confidence. Spotify did not say when it plans to make Confidence more widely available. It’s worth noting that Confidence is Spotify’s second commercial product for monetizing developers. Last December, Spotify unveiled its plan to monetize developers via its open source Backstage project. Spotify Backstage is platform designed to bring order to companies’ infrastructure by enabling them to build customized “developer portals,” combining all their tooling, apps, data, services, APIs and documents in a single interface. Today’s announcement indicates that although Spotify is mainly known for its consumer-facing music streaming service, it’s looking to branch out beyond that notion."
2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/aws-revenue-growth-dropped-to-12-in-q2-but-company-remains-optimistic-about-cloud-biz/,TechCrunch,"AWS revenue growth dropped to 12% in Q2, but company remains optimistic about cloud biz","Amazon has seen AWS growth rates dropping substantially over the last three quarters, from 20% to 16% to 12% this quarter. That’s not the kind of trend any company wants to see, but especially for a division like AWS, which has been a growth driver for Amazon over the years. Still, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy believes that the company might have turned the corner in its cloud business, while putting those results into context. “While customers have continued to optimize [their cloud spend] during the second quarter, we’ve started seeing more customers shift their focus toward driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. As a result, we’ve seen AWS’ revenue growth rate stabilize during Q2 where we reported 12% year-over-year growth,” Jassy said in the earnings call with analysts. CFO Brian Olsavsky, who had warned analysts in their February meeting that growth was dropping into the teens, was much more optimistic this week, especially given the prospect of future revenue the company believes it will eventually be generating from interest in generative AI. “I would add that we saw Q2 trends continue into July. So, generally I feel the business has stabilized, and we’re looking forward to the back-end of the year in the future because, as Andy said, there’s a lot of new functionality coming out with — and there’s a lot of spend that will be in this area for all the great solutions that are out there for generative AI and large language models, as well as machine learning solutions that we’ve always had for customers. So, [we’re] optimistic and starting to see some good traction with our customers’ new volume,” Olsavsky told analysts. Jassy points out that given the size of the business, it’s still growing pretty robustly, even if it’s not growing at the rate it had been in prior years. “If you think about the AWS business being an $88 billion revenue run rate business, to grow double digits on a business that size with the amount of cost optimizing that’s been happening, to grow double digits, you have to be adding a lot of new customers and a lot of new workloads just to grow double digits,” Jassy said. And he sees AI, which even prior to the growing popularity of generative AI, was a decent business. “What I would say is that we have had a very significant amount of business in AWS driven by machine learning and AI for several years. And you’ve seen that largely in the form of compute as customers have been doing a lot of machine learning training and then running their models and production on top of AWS and our compute instances,” he said. He says while generative AI is still very much at the early stages, it has the potential to drive much more business over time. All that said, Olsavsky didn’t offer third-quarter guidance for AWS either, so it begs the question if he’s truly as optimistic as he and Jassy are suggesting, at least in the short term. Long term, however, it would seem that AWS still has a lot of room for growth in the years ahead, especially with plenty of workloads still left to move to the cloud, and the promise of building applications on top of large language models continuing to boost business."
2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/israel-cybersecurity-directorate-no-breach-malware/,TechCrunch,Israel cybersecurity agency says no breach after senior official self-infects home PC with malware,"Israel’s National Cybersecurity Directorate said there was “no breach” of its network after passwords belonging to a senior agency official were stolen from their home computer earlier this year and published online. A security researcher, who asked not to be named, told TechCrunch that they recently found the INCD official’s stolen credentials posted in mid-June in a public Telegram group known for sharing caches of passwords, crypto wallet keys and other sensitive data stolen from computers infected with the RedLine password stealing malware. TechCrunch has seen the public Telegram post containing the cache, which was advertised as a nondescript archive file containing the credentials of hundreds of victims, including the senior INCD official. The cache contained saved credentials, credit card numbers and auto-filled passwords from the official’s home computer, including passwords that relate to the senior official’s work at the INCD, such as threat detection services and other internal Israeli government systems. A desktop screenshot of the official’s home computer taken at the time of compromise and bundled in the cache of stolen credentials shows the INCD official mistakenly infecting their home computer with the RedLine malware. The screenshot prominently features a virtual machine running FlareVM, a custom software used by cybersecurity professionals for reverse-engineering and analyzing malware, with a sample of RedLine on the virtual machine’s desktop. RedLine is a notorious password-stealing malware, which was attributed to last year’s hack at Uber and the theft of login details from Worldcoin Orb operators. TechCrunch is not naming the INCD official, who did not respond to a request for comment. The INCD is responsible for defending Israel’s cyberspace against cyberattacks. When asked about the incident, INCD said the agency official “reported in accordance with our established security protocols,” but did not say when, or how long after the incident it was reported. “Following the event, the INCD launched a thorough investigation which confirmed that there was no breach to our well-secured organizational network,” said Libi Oz, a spokesperson for INCD. “The incident took place on a private computer, disconnected and isolated from the organization’s network, ensuring a clear separation between personal and work-related digital spaces, as required. In addition, there was no sensitive information stored on it,” the spokesperson added. INCD said that it “routinely applies a multi-layered security framework in the organizational network, which includes multi-factor authentication and other measures, to effectively prevent and minimize the potential impact of such incidents.” Read more on TechCrunch:"
2023-08-04,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/us-venture-capital-policy/,TechCrunch,The US could learn a lot from how the UK is crafting DEI policy for venture capital,"The U.K.’s Treasury Select Committee last month released a report on the diversity — or lack thereof — of the nation’s venture ecosystem. Black founders there receive less than 0.4% of all venture capital, and women founders receive around 2%, the report found. The report called such dismal stats “unacceptable”: And it’s not just in the U.K. In the U.S., funding to Black founders in H1 fell 40% from a year earlier — of the $75 billion invested in the first six months of 2023, just $565 million was raised by Black founders. And women in the U.S. consistently raise just 2% of funds allocated in any given year. As TechCrunch+ has frequently reported, firms and investors have taken only a few steps to create a more equitable landscape, but financial incentivization and a push from the government could help them go all the way. Brandon Brooks, a founding partner at Overlooked Ventures, said venture capital is already on the minds of many lawmakers in Washington. He said he was summoned to a hearing in April to discuss the U.S.’ venture capital landscape. Senators took an interest in the sector after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, looking to find more ways to impose regulation. During the hearing, some senators had qualms with the lack of funding and opportunities going to their own constituents. “Now that it’s been brought to their attention in a very public way, they’re going to start taking action,” Brooks said of how policymakers are now showing more interest in the industry. “We can now use [the U.K.] report as a guideline to say, ‘Let’s do something similar in the U.S.’” Ladi Greenstreet, the CEO at Diversity VC, was one of the many summoned by the Treasury Select Committee to share his experiences in the U.K. venture ecosystem. The Treasury had already responded to the report, saying it would consider the suggestions of its select committee. “But at the end of the day, it’s politics, so I can understand that a whole bunch of other things must happen for this to be put through,” Greenstreet told TechCrunch+.

Several former Discord employees posted on Twitter and LinkedIn that they were impacted by the layoffs. The job cuts have affected people in marketing, design and entertainment partnership teams. The company confirmed the development to Business Insider in a statement and added that it is focused on long-term growth. “Discord can confirm that approximately 4% of our team have been let go as part of the reorganization of some business units, and we are ensuring that those impacted are being supported. We are focused on the long-term growth of the business and delivering on our mission,” a company spokesperson told the publication. Last month, Discord rolled out a Family Center as an opt-in tool to better inform parents and guardians about their children’s activity on the app. The company also introduced a feature to let users directly stream Xbox gameplay to servers and DMs. In March, Discord updated its Clyde bot with OpenAI’s ChatGPT tech so users can ask it for suggestion during a group chat. Last week, investment firm Fidelity improved the value of some of its holdings, including Discord and Reddit. This was a positive sign as compared to June, when Fidelity cut its Discord holdings’ valuation to $1.7 million — down 47% since the original investment of $3.3 million made in 2021."
2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/fisker-reveals-all-electric-alaska-pickup-three-other-ev-prototypes/,TechCrunch,"Fisker reveals all-electric Alaska pickup, 3 other EV prototypes","Fisker, the automotive startup-turned publicly traded company founded by famed automotive designer Henrik Fisker, revealed Thursday night a dizzying array of EV prototypes, from a beefy pickup truck with an expandable bed and grand tourer sports car with up to 600 miles of range to a souped-up, off-road version of its Ocean SUV and the mysterious PEAR vehicle that it plans to build with Foxconn. The showcase, which was part of an event in Huntington Beach, California for investors and media, was the first time that Fisker has shown off all of its future vehicles in prototype form and laid out its expansive and ambitious future product plan. And Fisker is taking reservations for all of them. “I think the traditional car industry really liked this idea about coming up with a new car every year or every second year, but I think we’re in a completely different time right now. You know, coming out of the COVID hangover,” Henrik Fisker told TechCrunch. “My strategy is, I kind of want to seize the moment. And rather than looking at COVID as something that’s gonna stop us or slow us down, I kind of want to accelerate. And the reason is that I believe that the entire pie of the market is up for grabs, probably in the next three years.” While the EVs shown Thursday are only prototypes and the specifics are scarce, the company did share some new details that provide a clearer picture of what road — or roads — Fisker is taking. Image Credits: Abigail Bassett CEO Henrik Fisker has called the pickup the “Ferrari of pickups,” targeting other successful all-electric luxury pickups in the space, including Rivian’s highly popular Rivian R1T, the still-vaporware Tesla Cybertruck and the Ford F-150 Lightning. The Alaska is built on a similar platform as the Ocean, but it’s been stretched slightly. Fisker calls the platform under the Alaska the FT31. The company said the EV pickup will be built by automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Europe at the same plant as the Ocean. Fisker said Thursday that the Alaska will get up to 340 miles of all-electric range along with some unique features, including a “big gulp” cupholder and water bottle, an extendable bed that goes from a 4.5 feet to 7.5 feet with the push of a button, and various cubbies and storage bins, including one for a cowboy hat. The extendable bed has an interesting feature that might be attractive to campers. The back window of the cab and rear wall can be dropped, allowing the cabin to open up to the truck bed and lengthening the entire area (when the tailgate is down) to 9 feet, 6 inches. This feature, which Fisker calls the Houdini Trunk, would offer a sort of sleeping platform for owners or could be used to carry longer items. Image Credits: Abigail Bassett Henrik Fisker noted in an interview with TechCrunch that the company is considering adding “all kinds of fun stuff” for the Alaska truck to go head-to-head with the Rivian R1T, a pickup known for its thoughtful accessories like the hidden flashlight, Bluetooth speaker and since discontinued camp kitchen. Fisker said that the Alaska will come to market in 2024 and have a starting price of $45,400 before incentives. With incentives, Fisker says that the Alaska will cost $37,900. Reservations for the Fisker Alaska opened this evening with deliveries taking place sometime in 2025, according to the company. Image Credits: Abigail Bassett Alongside the Alaska, Fisker showed off the PEAR for the first time. The PEAR, which stands for Personal Electric Automotive Revolution, was going to be built in conjunction with Foxconn at the Lordstown Motors plant in Ohio. Lordstown Motors has since filed for bankruptcy and sued against Foxconn. It’s unclear if the PEAR will still be built at that location. Fisker says that the $29,900 (before incentives) PEAR gets up to 300 miles of range in its dual motor, all-wheel drive form and calls the vehicle a “fully connected mobility device” complete with on-board supercomputers that reportedly handle as much as 6.2 teraflops of data. The supercomputers have been built in-house by Fisker and are called Fiskerblades. The range for the Pear is roughly 50 miles less than other high-volume EVs like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and 6, both of which are priced in the $40,000 range, but no automaker has yet been able to build and offer an EV for under $30,000. To keep the price of the PEAR low, Fisker is going for the volume play, noting that once the Lordstown plant ramps up production, the company plans to build 250,000 PEARs per year at that location. At tonight’s event, Henrik Fisker said that he eventually hopes to build 1 million Pears per year at factories around the world, including those in the U.S., China, Europe and India. The PEAR is built on what Fisker calls the SLV1, or Simple Light Volume platform, and will have an all-steel body and frame. The company said it has used an internal development process to make manufacturing more efficient and lower costs. For instance, many of the parts inside the smaller EV crossover are interchangeable and the armrests on the doors are exactly the same. Fisker said it was able to take out 35% of the parts in order to lower cost and make it easier and faster to assemble. Henrik Fisker confirmed that the PEAR is done in terms of design and the company is currently going out to suppliers to get it built. Fisker said that the PEAR will be coming in mid-2025. One unique feature of the PEAR is the rear tailgate which neither opens up or down like traditional tailgates. Instead, it slides down into the rear bumper and disappears. The company also refers to this as the “Houdini Trunk,” the same name it uses for a somewhat similar disappearing act in the pickup. The PEAR also comes with an option for a bench seat in the front, offering optional seating for three people, rather than two, increasing the compact passenger car capacity to as many as six people. The PEAR also gets a lounge seating option, where the front seats can lay back and people can watch a movie on the center screen (the five-passenger version gets the same 17-inch screen as the Ocean) from the rear when charging. Reservations for the “urban EV,” which is about the size of a Subaru Crosstrek, opened in February of last year. The company says they have more than 70,000 reservations for the Ocean and the PEAR, combined. Image Credits: Abigail Bassett The all-electric Ronin, which was also shown in prototype form, marks Henrik Fisker’s return to the high-end luxury sports car market. The vehicle — named after the movie “Ronin” that is famous for its multiple car chase scenes — is meant to showcase Fisker’s vision of the future supercar and serves as the technology “carrier” for all the other vehicles in the lineup. To the CEO, that means a four-door, grand tourer with butterfly-winged doors, a coupe-like sloping roofline and tri-motor powertrain that produces more than 1,000 horsepower and can travel 0 to 60 miles per hour in around two seconds. The vehicle will be equipped with a retractable carbon fiber roof that can fit in its trunk. If that’s not wild enough, Fisker says it will still be spacious enough to fit up to five people and their luggage. The Ronin will be equipped with a new type of battery pack integrated into the body of the grand tourer with a targeted 600-mile range, Fisker said Thursday. If successful, that would put the Ronin’s range far ahead of any other EV on the market. Production starts in the second half of 2024, according to the company. The big surprise Thursday was the Force E, an off-roader version of the Ocean SUV — its only EV currently on the market. Image Credits: Abigail Bassett Fisker widened the Ocean SUV with fenders and added a skid plate and eye-catching 33-inch wheels. The company, which called the Force E a “hardcore off-road package,” will be available in the first quarter of 2024."

The raise was described as a mix of equity and debt capital. The company has been on something of an acquisition roll, using its war chest to roll-up complementary products, such as its acquisition last year of Germany-based Studienkreis, a traditional tutoring company. The edtech unicorn (which has attained an estimated €3 billion valuation) says the raise will be used to bring “enhanced hybrid learning solutions to the DACH region.” In plain English, that means more online and offline educational support and an expansion of the use of its GoVR — GoStudent’s newly launched virtual reality language learning platform. And of course, the company now says it has an “AI vision” and plans to “prioritise the creation of AI-driven tools.” Join the AI queue… It now has around 23,000 tutors on its platform and will develop an “AI lesson plan generator” trained on the local curriculum. The idea is that it will save each tutor an average of 15 minutes per lesson. In a statement GoStudent CEO and co-founder Felix Ohswald said: “We see daily the impact that tailored learning can have on a child’s confidence. By offering AI-driven study support or virtual reality lessons in group environments, alongside traditional tutoring, a truly bespoke learning path can be created for each individual child – readying them for their future.” Harley Miller, CEO and managing partner at Left Lane Capital, added: “As GoStudent doubles down on its existing VR capabilities, introduces smart AI tools, and drives synergies with Studienkreis, we see even further potential to complete its vision of hybrid offline and online tutoring.”"

But now erstwhile backer, Twitter haver and X lover Elon Musk appears to have taken the valuable domain off their hands, or else someone has done it for him: AI.com now redirects to X.ai, the billionaire’s embryonic machine learning research outfit. Of course domains are bought and sold every day. But two-letter .com domains are rare and highly expensive, especially those that form words or familiar abbreviations. When AI.com started redirecting to OpenAI’s site, Mashable pointed out that the domain could hardly have sold for less than IT.com’s $3.8 million the previous year, and likely attained a far higher price given the hype around artificial intelligence in general. No doubt OpenAI hoped that the purchase of AI.com would turn confused URL bar typers into lifetime users. Or perhaps it intended to eventually move its consumer-facing operations (like ChatGPT’s web client) over to the shorter domain. It seems we’ll never know, because now the domain goes to X.ai. The news seems to have first been reported by Analytics India Magazine (perhaps a bidder itself at some point), but the truth is outside the transfer, there is precious little to say about the switch. It’s just bizarre and expensive enough to warrant noting here. X.ai is still a largely notional organization, with a handful of academics and engineers working on, one imagines, whatever Musk tells them to. Its stated goal is “to understand the true nature of the universe,” but they haven’t made any visible progress since the site went up in July. Admittedly Musk has been busy during that time. What could it mean? Did Sam Altman tire of his toy? Was the plan to shift to the new domain scrapped in favor of a new one? Was the sale tentative to begin with, or perhaps a month-to-month lease? Was there a bidding war, or did someone lose interest? Whatever the case, it ends up just feeling like a couple rich guys squabbling over a shiny object. ChatGPT is the most recognizable brand in AI — so why pay millions to start a new one from scratch? And X.ai is already short and memorable (or at least it will be until there are eight other Musk companies called X), and there’s nothing worth looking at on the site, so why pay so much to redirect another empty site? It’s worth noting that OpenAI never did actually confirm it bought the domain, and Musk has not yet, and would never return our emails. Logo from a recent staging site for AI.com I will say that if I had $10 million and the opportunity to buy AI.com, you know what I would do? Redirect it to the obvious candidate and then dangle it in front of their competitors for a 50% markup. If that didn’t work, I’d switch it to the rival and offer it to the first company. Here’s hoping some information superhighwayman (if you will) had the same brainwave and squeezed one of these billionaires for a solid payday. If so, well played. I suspect that ultimately no one actually cares who owns AI.com, and people in fact may be suspicious of whatever corporate entity controls what is obviously a vanity domain. Let’s all just agree not to use it. That will teach everyone a lesson."
2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/apple-services-growth-continues-to-counter-iphone-sales-slide-in-q3/,TechCrunch,Apple services growth continues to counter iPhone sales slide in Q3,"Apple’s Q3 earnings presented a mixed bag for the company, as iPhone revenue continued to slide. The handset brought in $39.67 billion for the quarter, down from $40.66 this time last year. The drop certainly isn’t an anomaly amid an overall declining smartphone market. Once again, however, the hardware slowdown was blunted by the company’s continued success in services, as revenue increased from $19.6 billion to $21.2 billion, year-over-year, beating analyst expectations. Apple naturally led with the services win when announcing those earnings today. “We are happy to report that we had an all-time revenue record in Services during the June quarter, driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions, and we saw continued strength in emerging markets thanks to robust sales of iPhone,” CEO Tim Cook said in a release. “From education to the environment, we are continuing to advance our values, while championing innovation that enriches the lives of our customers and leaves the world better than we found it.” It’s bad all over for smartphone makers — and has been for a few years now, owing to slowed upgrade cycles, rising prices, supply chain constraints and various economic headwinds, among others. Apple’s play was, however, bolstered by growth in China. Sales in Greater China were up 8% y-o-y, as Apple says it managed to grow in market share in the world’s largest smartphone market. Meanwhile, in an interview with CNBC, Cook said the company has been quietly working on generative AI for years. “We view AI and ML as fundamental core technologies. And they are virtually embedded in every product that we build,” the executive explained. “On a research basis, we’ve been doing research on AI and machine learning, including generative AI, for years.” The statement comes as chief competitors like Microsoft and Google have garnered headlines for the work being done in the extremely buzzy category. Cook also highlighted plans to demo its Vision Pro headset in stores. The “spatial computing” device announced at WWDC in June is set for release some time early next year."
2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/nikola-finally-gets-enough-shareholder-support-to-issue-more-shares/,TechCrunch,Nikola finally gets enough shareholder support to issue more shares,"After three attempts and a change in Delaware law, EV truck maker Nikola was able to get enough shareholders to vote on a proposal that will allow it to issue more shares. Nikola said Thursday it received the requisite number of votes to pass a proposal that authorizes the board to issue more shares. If investors bite, Nikola could raise the capital it says it needs to keep operations running and ramp up commercial production.   Companies incorporated in Delaware that wanted to issue more shares used to need more than 50% of all outstanding shares to vote in favor of the proposal. Under the change that went into effect August 1, companies now only need to receive a simple majority of the votes cast. Nikola failed to get enough shareholders to vote at its June 7 and July 6 meetings.  “We are immensely grateful for the unwavering support and confidence our stockholders have demonstrated in Nikola with the passage of all of this year’s Proposals,” Nikola CEO Michael Lohscheller said in a statement. “This positive outcome, particularly with respect to Proposal 2, was critical for continued growth and success as we move forward with our strategic priorities, including autonomous technologies and software, our HYLA hydrogen ecosystem and the recent launch of the Nikola hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle.” Nikola is among a group of EV and mobility startups that went public via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies before generating revenue. Many of these, with Nikola leading the pack, were swept up in the meme stock craze during the pandemic and saw shares — and market cap —skyrocket. All of these stocks have come crashing back down to earth, leaving EV SPACs like Nikola scrambling for cash. Nikola has also cut costs. In May, the company laid off 270 employees, or about 23% of its workforce, and announced plans to restrict electric truck efforts to North America. About 150 workers who were supporting the company’s European programs were laid off. Another 120 employees based at the company’s Phoenix and Coolidge, Arizona sites also lost their jobs. About 900 employees remain."
2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/coinbase-q2-2023-earnings/,TechCrunch,"Coinbase Q2 earnings exceed estimates, signaling potential market recovery","Coinbase reported its second-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon after the bell, beating market estimates. During Q2, the second largest crypto exchange by trading volume generated total revenues of $707.9 million, down from $772.5 in the previous quarter and $808.3 million in the year-ago quarter. It also had a $97 million net loss and generated a positive adjusted EBITDA of $194 million during the quarter. It was a mixed bag of estimates from analysts prior to the earnings report. Some expected lower results, while others were optimistic. But now crypto bulls and company shareholders alike can breathe a sigh of relief. “One year ago in Q2 2022, we started reducing our expense base to operate more efficiently. One year later, we’re proud to say that our quarterly recurring operating expenses have dropped nearly 50% Y/Y,” the company said in its Q2 2023 shareholder letter. In after-hours trading, shares of Coinbase rose 7% to about $96.70 after its earnings were posted, but retracted 2% to around $89 at the time of publication. Coinbase’s stock is up about 170% year-to-date. As of June 30, 2023, Coinbase had $92 billion in quarterly volume traded, $128 billion assets on its platform, according to its website. The firm’s Q1 earnings reported in May posted $773 million in revenue. "

BMW told investors Thursday that EVs made up 12.6% of the firm’s total deliveries during the first half of 2023, up from 10% for the entirety of 2022. BMW aims for its share of battery-electric sales to hit 15% by the end of 2023. As demand for battery-powered cars climbs, BMW’s chief financial officer said the firm is now “investing more than originally planned in the global ramp-up of e-mobility,” according to Bloomberg. BMW’s second-quarter 2023 earnings reflect this shift; the automaker said it boosted its research and development spending by nearly 19% from Q2 2022, up to about $2 billion in Q2 2023. BMW still won’t say when it’ll stop selling gas guzzlers. CEO Oliver Zipse declined to set an end date during the firm’s earnings call, arguing that there’s “no indication that the world is renouncing combustion engine vehicles.” This attitude contrasts automakers such as Mercedes-Benz, Ford and GM — all companies that have shared plans to phase out combustion-engine sales by 2040. "

According to one recent survey, 35% of SaaS businesses already use AI, while another 42% plan to in the near future. Yet the potential risks are as numerous as the benefits, and this reality creates challenges to building AI into SaaS applications. We’re excited to have three leading experts who can unpack those challenges on the SaaS Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, which takes place September 19–21 in San Francisco. Panelists — including Ines Chami, chief scientist, Numbers Station; David DeSanto, chief product officer, GitLab; and Navrina Singh, founder and CEO, Credo AI — will join us for a discussion called “AI for SaaS.” The discussion will center around whether, why and how you should make AI part of your core product. And, given AI’s well-known bias and toxicity problem (algorithms can end up discriminating against or causing harm to certain segments of customers), how to do so ethically and responsibly. Other areas we’ll look at include jumping on the AI bandwagon (not every problem requires AI to find a solution), the risks associated with cloud-based AI and uploading sensitive data through a third-party server, and the potential liability issues stemming from using AI trained on public and even copyrighted data. We’ll also likely touch on regulation — like the EU’s AI Act, which may introduce roadblocks to implementing AI in SaaS.  Learn more about our speakers — and their qualifications for tackling this challenging topic — below. Ines Chami received her PhD from the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University. Prior to attending Stanford, she studied mathematics and computer science at École Centrale Paris.  Chami is particularly excited about building intelligent models to automate data-intensive work. Her work spans applications such as knowledge graph construction and data cleaning. For her work on graph representation learning, Chami won the 2021 Stanford Gene Golub Doctoral Dissertation Award. While getting her PhD, she interned at Microsoft AI and Research and Google Research, where she co-authored the graph representation learning chapter of Kevin Murphy’s book “Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction.” David DeSanto focuses on delivering a stellar product experience to GitLab’s users from startups to global enterprises. He leads GitLab’s Product division (product management, product monetization and operations, user experience) to define and execute GitLab’s product vision and roadmap.  He is responsible for facilitating strong collaboration between product, engineering, the CEO and other executives. DeSanto also leverages customer and industry feedback to build, ship and support products that improve GitLab’s position within the DevSecOps market. DeSanto holds an MS in cybersecurity from New York University and a BS in computer science from Millersville University of Pennsylvania. He is a frequent speaker at major international conferences on topics such as threat intelligence, cloud security, GNSS security issues and SSL/TLS issues, in addition to being the co-author of “Threat Forecasting.” Navrina Singh is the founder and CEO of Credo AI, an AI governance platform that empowers organizations to deliver and embed artificial intelligence responsibly by proactively measuring, monitoring and managing AI risks.  Before founding Credo AI, Singh spent nearly two decades building products in mobile, SaaS and AI at companies like Microsoft and Qualcomm. She is a member of the U.S. Department of Commerce National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee (NAIAC), which advises the president and the National AI Initiative Office. Singh is also a young global leader with the World Economic Forum and currently served as an executive board member of Mozilla, supporting its trustworthy AI charter. She lives in Palo Alto with her family. TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 takes place in San Francisco on September 19–21. You can save up to $600, but the deadline is August at 11:59 p.m. PDT.

2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/rivian-elects-former-waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-to-board/,TechCrunch,Rivian elects former Waymo CEO John Krafcik to board,"John Krafcik, who led autonomous vehicles company Waymo for five years, has joined Rivian’s board of directors, according to a regulatory filing. EV maker Rivian increased the size of its board and elected Krafcik to serve as a director, the filing said. His term will expire in 2024, when Rivian holds its annual shareholder meeting. The board also appointed Krafcik to its audit committee, replacing the spot held by Pamela Thomas-Graham. She is now a member of the board’s planet and policy committee. “We are thrilled to welcome John to the Rivian board,” Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. “John has tremendous leadership experience in the automotive industry and an impressive track record of building and leading innovative companies. His expertise in manufacturing engineering and automotive technology will be a valuable addition to our team. I’m confident that John will play a key role in helping us achieve our mission to electrify transportation and make it more sustainable.” Krafcik was part of Waymo’s transition from a special project at Google to its own business unit. During his tenure, the company rebranded to Waymo and locked in several partnerships with automakers such as Chrysler (now Stellantis) and Jaguar. Waymo also ramped up its testing and development and eventually launched a commercial robotaxi service in Phoenix during his time there. Before Krafcik became CEO of Waymo he was well known in the automotive industry, spending a decade at Hyundai North America in top executives positions. He worked in product development at Ford earlier in his career. Before taking the Waymo CEO gig, Krafcik had been president of online used car marketplace TrueCar. Krafcik resigned as CEO of Waymo in April 2021 and remained in an advisory role for another year. That position is now held by two people: Tekedra Mawakana, who was COO, and Dmitri Dolgov, who was part of the original Google self-driving project and was most recently CTO."
2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/eventmobi-acquires-a16z-backed-virtual-events-platform-run-the-world/,TechCrunch,EventMobi acquires a16z-backed virtual events platform Run The World,"EventMobi, an event management software provider based in Toronto, Canada, today announced that it’s agreed to acquire Run The World, an Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)-backed platform for online events, for an undisclosed amount. Bob Vaez, the founder and CEO of EventMobi, said that the purchase will enable EventMobi to “double down” on delivering diverse event formats, expand its reach and “solidify [its] position as industry leaders.” In the coming months, Run The World customers will be able to sign up to join EventMobi’s product platform, with EventMobi’s customer success teams assisting in the transition. “We’re standing at the dawn of a new era for business conferences, events and communities,” Vaez said in a canned statement. “The future of events will blend in-person and virtual experiences to foster and engage communities. We are committed to enabling our customers to choose the best format to allow their attendees to learn, connect and exchange ideas year-round.” Launched in 2019 by Xiaoyin Qu, who previously led products for both Facebook and Instagram, and Xuan Jiang, Qu’s former colleague at Meta, Run The World offered a range of capabilities to facilitate online conferencing, including tools for event ticketing, interactivity and networking. For customers — i.e. organizations hosting virtual events — Run The World created templates, handled ticket payment processing and streaming infrastructure and oversaw post-event follow-up and outreach. One of Run The World’s more unique features was “video profiles,” which were akin to Instagram stories — designed to help event attendees inform other attendees about who they are. The platform also organized what it called “cocktail parties,” where attendees could match and converse with each other several minutes at a time before, during or after live events. Run The World — based in Mountain View, with small teams in China and Taiwan — managed to raise $14.8 million in venture capital from backers including the aforementioned a16z, Pear VC, GGV Capital and Founders Fund. The pandemic supercharged its growth, even in the face of competition from events and videoconferencing platforms like Bevy, Hopin and Eventmaker as well as incumbents such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet. (Disclosure: TechCrunch has been a customer of Hopin’s.) Run The World claims to have connected “millions” of users across a customer base that included brands like Forbes, Meta, Amazon, United Nations Development Programme and Harvard University, hosting over 50,000 virtual events from its founding until now. One assumes that business cooled down slightly in the post-pandemic world as in-person events ramped up. An article in the FT from April 2022 noted that its “explore” tab, for discovering virtual conferences that one might want to attend, listed fewer than 500 events — down from more than 15,000 in November 2020. This perhaps precipitated Run The World’s sale; rival Hopin sold its events and engagement units to RingCentral this week for similar reasons. But Qu wouldn’t confirm or deny. “We couldn’t have anticipated the explosive interest Run The World would generate,” Qu said in a press release. “Now, as the world settles back to in-person events, we’re thrilled to join forces with EventMobi. We assure our community they are in the best hands and can expect even more powerful and seamless hybrid event solutions.” For EventMobi, the purchase complements the company’s existing events hosting and planning services and products. Founded in 2010, EventMobi started as a mobile event app provider. But now, it offers a full suite of management tools, including registration and check-in, year-round communities, exhibitor lead capture and a set of engagement and networking tools for in-person and virtual conferences."
2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/monthly-nft-sales-fell-for-fifth-consecutive-month-to-495m-in-july/,TechCrunch,Monthly NFT sales fell for fifth consecutive month to $495M in July,"Welcome back to Chain Reaction. To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important crypto stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday at 12 p.m. PT, subscribe here. The NFT space isn’t doing too well right now. Although it seems like there’s a new project being launched every week, there’s less and less money being spent in the space. In July, NFT sales totaled $495.6 million, down 23% from $646.1 million in June, according to data from NFT aggregator CryptoSlam. This marks the fifth consecutive month of NFT sales falling since February, when the sector saw sales hit $1.2 billion. July recorded the lowest level since April 2021, which saw sales at $339.4 million, a few months before the NFT boom began in July 2021. Today’s decline could be attributed to a number of factors, like consumers buying NFTs for less — the average sale in July was just $47, meaning fewer people are interested in “blue-chip” NFTs. It’s worth noting that transaction levels have remained high in the past couple of months — June had about 10.8 million transactions and July had about 10.4 million, the highest levels since February 2022. The decline in sales doesn’t necessarily mean NFTs are going bye-bye. Instead, it points to the growing prevalence of low-barrier NFT sales and the space becoming more accessible to general audiences, who may not want to spend a lot on NFTs right away. In the past 30 days, the top three blockchains to sell the most NFTs were Ethereum at $293 million, Bitcoin at $56.2 million and Solana at $35 million, per CryptoSlam data. Only two NFTs –— a Bored Ape Yacht Club and a CryptoPunk — were sold for over $1 million during that time. Regardless of how you look at it, the decline in NFT sales means the players and builders in the sector have to look for new opportunities to grow again. It’s time to sink or swim. For this week’s news episode, Jacquelyn sits down with Jesse Pollak, lead for Base and head of protocols at Coinbase. You might remember him from an interview we did with him back in April. Coinbase, which is the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, launched Base, an Ethereum-focused layer-2 (L2) blockchain, in February. The platform was in testnet, which is a test phase of the blockchain network, until mid-July, when it launched its mainnet, the fully live version of a blockchain on the main network (hence the name: mainnet) to developers. Next week, Base is officially launching its mainnet to the public on August 9, alongside its “Onchain Summer” initiative. We dive into what’s going on, why it matters, where Pollak sees Base going in the future and why he’s keeping an eye on the bigger layer-2 ecosystem.

2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/the-san-francisco-giants-will-wear-big-cruise-ads-through-2025/,TechCrunch,The San Francisco Giants will wear big Cruise ads through 2025,"One of the fringe benefits of owning a professional sports team is the ability to sell ads on just about everything. Stadiums have been at it for some time, of course. Who can forgot when the Staples Center became the more ominous Crypto.com Arena at the end of 2021? Uniform patches have been a thing for some time, as well, proving that nothing is above becoming a mobile billboard. Soccer fans have seen it for years, and more recently the NHL and NBA have followed suit. It’s a newer phenomenon in the world of Major League Baseball, with clubs approving sponsored patches at the beginning of the current season, alongside changes like the pitch clock, bigger bases and the shift ban. The beginning of the 2023 season saw seven of the league’s 30 teams selling sponsorships. It included a broad range of industries, from supermarkets (the Reds/Kroger) to concrete manufacturers (Braves/Quikrete). A couple of tech firms were in the mix as well, as the Padres got Motorola and the Diamondbacks donned component distributor Avnet. Today the San Francisco Giants announced a deal to add a massive Cruise patch — a fitting sponsor, perhaps, given how ubiquitous the driverless cars have become on the mountain range known as San Francisco streets. As a baseball fan who continues to hate these sorts of deals with a white-hot passion, I gotta say — it’s a pretty decent-looking patch. You know, for a huge advertisement that occupies most of a player’s upper arm. At the very least, it’s less off-putting than the big white and red patch that graced Mets uniforms at the top of the season. I’d suggest that was the reason the team has had a rough go of it, but let’s be honest, it’s the Mets we’re talking about here (sorry Mets fans — I’m a lifelong A’s fan; don’t talk to me about pain). The patch is rolling out to Giants uniforms starting today and running through 2025, by which point robo umps will presumably be arriving at Oracle Park in their own self-driving cars."
2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/privacy-focused-brave-search-launches-its-own-image-and-video-search/,TechCrunch,Privacy-focused Brave Search launches its own image and video search,"Privacy-focused search engine and browser maker Brave is taking another step away from its reliance on other search providers with today’s news that it has now launched its own image and video search engine. That means users will no longer have to leave Brave when they want either image or video search results, as the results will now be served directly from Brave Search’s own independent index, the company explains. The news follows Brave’s April announcement that it would no longer use Bing’s index, which had previously represented 7% of all query results. The image and video search feature has been in development for several months and its results will now also be offered via the recently launched Brave Search API, says Brave. Ahead of the launch, Brave had offered the option of an alternate image or video search through a redirect to Bing or Google, which was a feature that would allow users to search in a familiar format while Brave’s own index was in development. Image Credits: Brave “We realize that the redirect option was not popular with some of our users, and thank them for their patience during this transition,” a blog post announcing Brave’s new capabilities reads. “This was a temporary decision to help users find results with minimum hassle, while we worked to offer a sustainable, privacy-preserving, and independent image and video search option.” The company notes the ability to search for images and videos within the Brave ecosystem will allow users to benefit from increased speed and privacy, compared with other search engines that rely on third-party providers. But it also positions the launch as a means of putting a check on “Big Tech censorship,” citing an example from a couple of years ago when Microsoft Bing was found to serve up no images for a search for Tiananmen Square “tank man.” This had impacted Brave at the time because it was still relying on Bing’s image search results. Brave’s image search results are still being improved, the company cautions. For the time being, certain advanced filters like license type or aspect ratio will not be immediately available. But these will be added soon, it says. The Brave Search engine is the default in the company’s own Brave web browser, but can be used independently at search.brave.com."
2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/moonwares-ai-lets-airfield-ground-crews-ditch-the-walkies/,TechCrunch,Moonware’s AI lets airfield ground crews ditch the walkies,"The fact that any flight departs on time is a minor miracle, one that requires the precise synchronization of thousands of data points and an equally large workforce on the ground. Much of this the passenger never sees — especially the ground support crews and infrastructure that load catering and baggage, refuel planes, and assist in taxiing. According to the founders of Los Angeles–based Moonware, this current status quo is begging for improvement. Regarding ground operations, “everything is still really manual and really uncoordinated,” Moonware co-founder and CEO Javier Vidal said in a recent interview. “Everything still works with walkie talkies and papers. . . . At the end of the day, it’s all a last-minute scramble to find the right people and the right equipment to service the flights on time.” Moonware’s solution is an AI-powered OS for ground ops it calls HALO, which algorithmically coordinates ground operations in real-time. The software considers variables like distance, departure and arrival times, and crew availability before automatically dispatching crew and equipment. The startup’s co-founders, Vidal and Saunon Malekshahi, say it will reduce delays, airfield congestion and plane turnaround time. The HALO software mines three main data streams: real-time flight information; crew schedules and task allocation; and ground positions and movement of the crew and the vehicles. This final data stream is proprietary to Moonware, and leverages work cell phones and low-cost GPS trackers to collate precise locations of all the “pieces” of the airfield workflow. It’s a solution that Malekshahi likened to an AI-enabled “ground traffic control platform,” similar to how air traffic control (ATC) directs aircraft on the ground and in airspace today. Like ATC, the HALO software is airfield agnostic; in addition to commercial airlines, it can be used by cargo carriers, defense, and eventually even eVTOL operators. Moonware’s solution has caught investor attention. The startup recently closed $2.5 million in pre-seed financing led by early-stage VC firm Third Prime, with participation from Zero Infinity Partners, The House Fund, Lorimer Ventures, Plug and Play, and several angel investors. Image credit: Moonware The three-year-old startup’s vision for the future of airfields is not just limited to software. Instead, Moonware has much larger ambitions to weave autonomy into every aspect of ground operations, from the vehicles that transport baggage to the pushback tractors that push the aircraft from the gate to the head of the runway. The autonomy piece is farther down the road, however. First, Moonware plans to launch the OS with commercial airlines, starting with airlines that insource their ground operations team: think the Delta Airlines hub at the Atlanta airport or United at SFO. Fortunately, while airlines are tightly regulated by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, the areas where ground operations take place are under no such similar authority — that means Moonware can launch, and hopefully scale, quickly. The company’s first paid initial deployment will be with an undisclosed “major carrier based out of Europe,” Vidal said. That deployment, which will take place in North America later this fall, will see HALO used to service around ten flights a day, scaled up to 15 to 20 flights per day over the course of four to 6 months. Moonware is hoping to expand vertically across the airlines’ hub airports, with the expectation that HALO will have a network effect as more hubs use it. The time savings would compound, Vidal said: “We can save five minutes in one airport, and three minutes in another, and two minutes in another — all of a sudden, those minutes compound into hours’ worth of openings in their schedule. That’s where they can really add in more flights every day without having to purchase new aircraft, so no extra capex.” The company is also in conversation with the U.S. Air Force, which also struggles with ground ops coordination. In fact, Vidal said their problems are arguably worse than those facing commercial aviation: “In their control towers, they essentially have whiteboards with magnets,” he said. “Whenever an aircraft or something moves on the air side, they move a magnet across a whiteboard.” If all goes to plan, Moonware wants to introduce autonomy to ground ops likely later in the decade. It’s a capability that will be especially useful as new forms of transportation, like eVTOL and even commercial hypersonic flight, become operational. Malekshahi pointed to United Airlines’ massive $1 billion order with eVTOL developer Archer Aviation as a strong signal that electric aircraft will likely be integrated into commercial airports today. As airports support more forms of air travel, walkie-talkies and paper schedules will no longer cut it, Vidal added. “We really see airports becoming hubs uniting all of these different modes of air travel,” he said. “The needs to service these aircraft are going to vary completely. Essentially what HALO is creating is that ecosystem to manage all the different servicing needs for all these different aircraft, ensuring compatibility and making that streamlined.”"

The company announced today that it’s making it easier for users to find and remove results about themselves, while also updating its policies on personal explicit images to remove this content from Search. The search giant is going to roll out a new dashboard that will inform users if web results with their contact information is showing up on Search. The new dashboard builds on Google’s “Results about you” tool that launched last year and makes it easy to request the removal of search results that contain your phone number, home address or email. With this new dashboard, you can quickly request the removal of your contact information from Google. Image Credits: Google You can access this tool in the Google app by clicking on your Google account photo and selecting “Results about you.” The tool is available in the U.S. in English for now, but Google is working on bringing it to new locations and languages soon. Earlier this year, Google rolled out a safeguard that helps protect people from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. With this update, explicit imagery — such as adult or graphic violent content — will now be blurred by default when it appears in Search results. The new SafeSearch blurring setting is rolling out for all users globally this month. You can adjust your settings and turn it off at any time, unless a guardian or school network administrator has locked the setting.  In addition, the company is making it easier to find parental controls directly in Search. You can do so by typing a relevant query like “google parental controls” or “google family link” and you will see a box with information on how to manage your parental controls.   Although Google already enables users to remove nonconsensual explicit imagery from Search, the search giant is now letting users remove explicit content that they uploaded themselves. Image Credits: Google “We have long had policies that enable you to remove non-consensual explicit imagery from Search,” Google wrote in a blog post. “Now, we’re building on these protections to enable people to remove from Search any of their personal, explicit images that they no longer wish to be visible in Search. For example, if you created and uploaded explicit content to a website, then deleted it, you can request its removal from Search if it’s being published elsewhere without approval. This policy doesn’t apply to content you are currently commercializing.” It’s worth noting that removing content from Google Search does not remove it from the web or other search engines. However, Google says it hopes these changes will users more control over private information appearing in Search."
2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/tesla-range-inflation-lawsuit-filed/,TechCrunch,The first Tesla ‘range inflation’ lawsuit has been filed,"Several Tesla owners have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. automaker over allegations of consumer fraud a week after a Reuters investigation found the company had exaggerated the range estimates of its EVs for years. The proposed class action lawsuit, Porter et al v. Tesla, Inc., was filed August 2 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Law firm Milberg Coleman Bryson Phillips Grossman is representing the Tesla owners in the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges Tesla violated state consumer fraud statutes when it falsely advertised the range of its electric vehicles. Lawyers representing the owners said that Tesla “grossly overvalued” the range — which is the estimated distance a vehicle can travel on a single battery charge — when selling the vehicles to consumers. “Understanding that this would be an important feature (if not the most important feature) to many consumers, and preying on this fact, Tesla marketed its electric vehicles as having a grossly overvalued range in an effort to increase sales to consumers,” the lawsuit states. Last week, Reuters reported that Tesla had inflated its range estimates, prompting owners to flood its service center over concerns that their vehicles needed service. The investigation, citing anonymous sources and industry experts, found that the directive to use algorithms to give rosier range numbers came from CEO Elon Musk. As sales exploded, service requests also grew. To thwart the influx of requests and help keep costs in check, Tesla created a special “diversion team” dedicated to handle so-called “range cases” — meaning owners complaining of lower ranges than expected, according to the Reuters report. Diversion team members were trained to tell owners that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction. They would also provide tips to customers on how to extend range. The team’s goal was to cancel as many of those appointments as possible, saving Tesla as much as $1,000 a visit, the Reuters investigation found."
2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/fcc-fines-robocaller-a-record-300m-after-blocking-billions-of-their-scam-calls/,TechCrunch,FCC fines robocaller a record $300M after blocking billions of their scam calls,"The FCC’s robocaller penalties are growing as the agency tracks down and terminates their operations — this time resulting in a record $300 million forfeiture. But whether and when that money will be paid is, as always, something of an open question. The robocaller in this case was known by a variety of names and had been scamming people since 2018, as the FCC announcement explains: The long-running scheme used the promise of selling auto warranties to collect personal information from people. As if the fake warranty wasn’t enough, the calls also exhibited the standard robocall characteristics of failing to identify the caller, failing to respect call consent laws (like the Do Not Call list), failing to provide a call-back number and spoofing the area code. Chances are you received at least one of these calls — the companies placed at least five billion of them. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel got a few herself, she mentioned in her accompanying remarks. “Armed with the facts [the FCC] gave phone companies permission to cut off this traffic before going one step further and directing them to block it outright. We got results. Following our action, the number of auto warranty calls fell by 99 percent,” she wrote. This effective and quick (at least, quick once they identified the culprits) action is due to various improvements to the FCC robocall enforcement mechanisms over the years. They’ve also established agreements with nearly all the Attorneys General in the U.S. so that they can coordinate with local law enforcement. But one thing they are still lacking is the ability to effectively hammer these malicious actors with proper fines. The FCC is limited to investigating, taking counter-actions (like asking phone companies to stop carrying certain callers), and documenting the extent of the alleged criminal activity. But their recommendation of a $300 million fine must be evaluated and prosecuted by the Justice Department. “What happens next?” writes Rosenworcel. “Under the law we will refer this Forfeiture Order to the Department of Justice to collect payment.  I hope, however, that Congress will consider giving the FCC authority to go to court and collect these fines ourselves.” Justice, like most federal agencies, is swamped; it may be a long time before anyone attempts to collect, and by the time they do, the robocallers will likely have covered their tracks or sequestered their earnings in forfeiture-proof vehicles. A few years ago I wrote about how these fines often end up largely unpaid or drastically reduced due to loopholes and a lack of resources on the enforcers’ side. Florida is a popular refuge for scammers due, among other things, to laws that shield certain property from being seized. Today’s operation is described as being “transnational,” which is not elaborated upon but strongly suggests even greater difficulties in tracking down and squeezing the money out of those responsible. Though it may play out like a game of whack-a-mole, if the FCC were not doing their part it’s likely our phones would be blowing up non-stop. “We know the scam artists behind these calls are relentless,” said Rosenworcel, “but we are coming for them, and won’t stop until we get this junk off the line.”"
2023-08-03,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/tiktok-competitor-triller-files-to-go-public/,TechCrunch,TikTok competitor Triller files to go public,"Triller has long teased its ambitions to go public, and now, the short-form video platform seems on its way to an IPO. Triller filed an S-1 on Wednesday, seeking to directly list on the New York Stock Exchange. The TikTok competitor previously tried to go public via SPAC in a $5 billion merger with SeaChange International, which was later scrapped; it also attempted a direct listing last year, which also didn’t seem to be successful. Triller has had a difficult few years, facing lawsuits over missed payments from Sony Music, Universal Music Group and rappers Timbaland and Swizz Beats, who created the Verzuz series. Per the filing, Triller was ordered to pay Sony Music about $4.6 million. The platform has also been accused of not delivering timely payments to its Assembly for Black Creators (ABC), per a report in
The Washington Post. However, Triller writes in its filing to go public that it expects to expand the ABC in 2023, and that it has paid out $2 million in monthly stipends and revenue share to this cohort of 200 creators. According to the S-1, Triller has raised more than $380 million in capital, some of which was taken on as debt. The platform has grown to 550 million sign-ups across its offerings, which includes its many acquisitions like Fangage, Julius, Amplify.ai, FITE TV, Cliqz and more. It also owns media properties like Verzuz and the Bare Knuckle Fighting Club. While Triller earned $47.7 million in revenue in 2022, it has lost money each year it’s operated. This is normal for a startup, but the losses are significant. The company lost $195.6 million last year, and in 2021, it lost $773.6 million."

The platform has been operating on the testnet, which is a test phase of the blockchain network, from late February until mid-July, when it launched its “builder only phase” for developers, Pollak said. “We’ve reached a point where we felt there was a critical mass and we wanted to turn on this thing for everyone.” Users can start bridging their funds onchain to mint NFTs and get a “taste for Base,” Pollak said. Upon the launch, Base will also kick off its Onchain Summer initiative, which aims to reframe the narrative around crypto to “something fun and engaging” by partnering with big consumer brands such as Coca-Cola and Atari, he said. The initiative will partner with Coinbase and over 50 brands, platforms, marketplaces and creators. “If you look at use cases people are building to bring media, music, food and games onchain. Just in the last six-nine months, the breadth and diversity of use cases has started to become mind-boggling, alongside other things you might expect like payments, stablecoins and messaging.” Since mid-July, a number of developers have deployed a number of smart contracts, testing out the chain for themselves. So far, Base has seen over $68 million worth of ether bridged to the network and over $200 million in trading volume and transactions, thanks to memecoins like BALD surging (and later plummeting). BALD was tradable through LeetSwap decentralized exchange, which is built on top of Base’s chain. “My first reaction was, ‘This is crypto; of course this is happening,’” Pollak said. “Was this in our plans? Absolutely not. We’ve been focused on builders and that’s who we remain focused on… but because Base is an open, permissionless ecosystem, you’re going to see people build all sorts of things. And that’s OK, that’s the beauty of crypto.” In general, Pollak sees onchain activity growing extremely quickly. In order to push toward their mission to “transform the internet,” the blockchain is partnering with Prop House to offer over 100 ether, or about $185,000, in grants, to builders building on Base this summer. “We’re excited to see other applications stand up alongside this activity happening organically.” This story was inspired by an episode of TechCrunch’s podcast Chain Reaction.

The restriction will also not apply to passengers carrying the mentioned devices in their baggage. The move, which follows a similar curb on smart TV imports years ago, is likely to help boost local manufacturing, but New Delhi did not offer an explanation. India’s ban on smart TV imports nearly three years ago boosted local manufacturing, according to analysts. The revised policy. Image Credits: Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India India has been providing incentives to firms in recent years in a bid to spur domestic production. The initiative has successfully drawn in a swath of smartphone manufacturers and is now increasingly piquing the interest of chipmakers and semiconductor producers. In May, the Narendra Modi government unveiled a $2 billion scheme aimed at promoting businesses locally building hardware like laptops, PCs, servers and related edge computing kits. The scheme was an upgrade to the previous program under which the government was willing to spend $892 million. “This policy announcement seems to be based on the premise of providing secure digital access to the burgeoning number of digital citizens in the country.  We are confident that valid licenses will be provided to trusted industry partners which will enable Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) and unrestricted access to trusted brands for digital consumers,” said Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of Indian Cellular and Electronics Association, in a statement. Dell and HP are among the companies that already have manufacturing facilities in India. The Indian government also aims to expand local production further and make the country a desirable location for Apple and its manufacturing partners to establish a global manufacturing hub. However, the country currently spends billions of dollars on importing laptops and other hardware. According to the government data shared in the parliament in December, the import value of finished electronic goods in India grew 32% to $43 billion in 2021–2022 from over $32 billion in 2019–2020. However, the incentives and schemes offered to boost local production helped drop the share of imported finished electronic goods (including components) in total imports of electronic goods to 64% in 2021–22, down from 69% in 2019–2020. Hong Kong–based market research firm Counterpoint estimates that around 30% to 35% of laptops and 30% of tablets shipped to India during the first half of 2023 were manufactured locally."
2023-08-02,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/tesla-rival-xpengs-head-of-autonomous-driving-quits-rumored-to-join-nvidia/,TechCrunch,"Tesla rival Xpeng’s head of autonomous driving quits, rumored to join Nvidia","Xpeng, a prominent Chinese electric vehicle maker and a competitor to Tesla, has announced the resignation of its vice president of autonomous driving, Xinzhou Wu, over personal and family reasons. Wu, formerly a senior director of engineering at Qualcomm where he spent over a decade, was effectively the head of Xpeng’s autonomous driving business and played a pivotal role in helping Xpeng gain an edge over its EV rivals in the intelligent driving race. The NYSE-listed EV upstart is recognized for its in-house, full-stack development team responsible for creating the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) Xpeng Navigation Guided Pilot (XNPG), which is considered a counterpart to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. In March, Xpeng upgraded its city navigation system for customers in first-tier cities like Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shanghai. In a few months, the system’s mileage penetration rate had exceeded 60%, Xpeng revealed on a recent earnings call. Moreover, the company aims to reduce the number of manual takeovers per 1,000 kilometers when using its highway navigation to one or fewer by the end of 2023. Tesla hasn’t made FSD available in China yet and recently denied rumors that it would introduce the option in Shanghai soon. Even if it had plans to do so, it would take the American giant at least 12 months to localize the system for China’s complex road conditions, Wu said in a previous interview. Wu hasn’t announced his next career move after five years with Xpeng, though widespread rumors suggest he’s taking up a senior position in Nvidia’s autonomous driving division. A Weibo post by He Xiaopeng, CEO and founder of Xpeng, hints at this possibility, as he expressed pride in Wu soon becoming a top-level manager at a globally renowned company with continued collaborations on chip technology with Xpeng. Indeed, Xpeng has had a longstanding chip partnership with Nvidia, which itself has made big strides into the autonomous vehicle space with its smart driving platform Drive and state-of-the-art auto chips. Wu is passing the torch to Liyun Li, currently senior director of autonomous driving at the firm. According to He, this transition has been in the works for nearly a year and he’s confident that it will play out “smoothly”. The separation appears to be amicable, as evidenced by Wu reciprocating He’s sentiment with a warm message on Weibo. “I believe Xpeng’s solid team and system will propel forward the development of ADAS until the era of driverless cars arrives.” The resignation of Wu, which is seen as a huge talent loss for Xpeng, came just a week after Xpeng announced a promising investment from Volkswagen that will see the pair co-develop electric vehicle models for the Chinese market. While Wu’s resignation may not have an immediate impact on Xpeng’s autonomous driving path, it does mark the end of an era at the firm. Wu belongs to a group of AI experts who returned from Silicon Valley to work at emerging Chinese tech companies while managing R&D teams in the U.S. With escalating tensions between the two global powers, numerous Chinese tech giants have downsized their U.S. operations. Xpeng turned many heads in the EV industry early this year after appointing Wang Fengying, a veteran with 20 years of experience at Chinese budget pick-up truck and SUV manufacturer Great Wall Motor, as president. To many’s surprise, Wang will be overseeing product planning at the young firm that prides itself on R&D. As Wu remarked in his farewell message, “Five years ago, I crossed the ocean to join Xpeng, landing on the right platform at the right time. I found myself stepping into a race that sent the wind and clouds and set the spirits ablaze.”"

The AI assistant, which arrived about nine months after SettleMint announced its €16 million Series A funding round, promises to help developers create smart contracts, integrate data, and enhance quality assurance (QA) testing. Despite a climate where digital currency prices have nosedived, the seven-year-old Belgium company is seeing steady user growth as more enterprises are recognizing the benefits of blockchain technology but lack the technical skills to bring their ideas to fruition. In a survey done by the programmer Q&A site Stack Overflow, only 1% of the respondents reported having done extensive work in Solidity, the programming language used to write smart contracts, which are self-executing digital contracts built on blockchains, normally Ethereum. SettleMint didn’t create the AI assistant to replace humans, said Roderik van der Veer, co-founder and CTO at SettleMint. The AI could help draft smart contracts, but its real value is explaining what each line of code does. “If you understand a piece of code, you know where you get it wrong,” said van der Veer. “So instead of having to look at the screen and trying to Google whatever you see, and processing all [the information on] the internet in your mind and [use] your Google skills to form a conclusion of what could be wrong, it does it for you.” While the AI assistant can suggest modifications to avoid vulnerabilities, the code won’t be bug-free, said van der Veer. Technical audits are still necessary, especially given the complexity of blockchain systems. But having SettleMint as the first layer of screening means auditors can spend more time on the “non-trivial” parts of the code to debug, the founder suggested. SettleMint is training the AI assistant mostly on OpenAI’s GPT-4 and supplying it with up-to-date information on blockchain development, which is transforming rapidly with frequent technical upgrades. Product screenshot of SettleMint’s new AI assistant. Image: SettleMint The “crypto winter” hasn’t had an adverse impact on SettleMint, which has been “growing quite a bit” in lead generation and signed contracts with sales multiplying 3–4x this year, according to van der Veer. Changing customer behavior also reflects a maturing of the enterprise blockchain space, as its users went from mostly “small teams within companies doing a specific project” to much larger groups undergoing “huge internal training.” Companies are also using smart contracts for different purposes in crypto’s market downturn. NFT use cases, observed van der Veer, are moving away from collectibles toward practical use cases such as ticketing and guarantees as proof of ownership. With offices in Leuven, Dubai, New Delhi, Singapore and Tokyo, SettleMint is pushing steadily into Asia with funding from the Japanese electronics giant Fujitsu, while it sees “a lot of growth” in the Middle East."

2023-08-02,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/djis-new-gopro-competitor-launches-at-399/,TechCrunch,DJI’s new GoPro competitor launches at $399,"The DJI/GoPro relationship has been an uneasy one ever since planned drone collaboration fell back down to earth some eight or so years back. After the deal fell through, GoPro launched its Karma drone, but ultimately failed to find purchase in a category that DJI continues to dominate. DJI, on the other hand, has entered the action camera space with considerably more success. The Osmo Action had some kinks to work out early on, but it’s also managed to bring innovative ideas to a category whose moment once appeared to have already past. Since then, the race between GoPro’s Hero and DJI’s Osmo Action has tightened considerably, with the two cameras running neck and neck. Case in point, the newly announced Osmo Action 4. The device goes toe-to-toe with the GoPro Hero 11 Black, and from the standpoint of sheer specs, there’s really no clear winner between the two. One place DJI does have the competition beat, however, is low light. The new Osmo Action has a much improved sensor to boost night shooting. Depending on what you’re looking for in this sort of a device, that may well be enough reason to jump ship to DJI. The Action is also a bit more compact at 70x44x33mm to the Hero’s 71x55x34mm. At 5.4 ounces, it’s also a touch lighter than the GoPro, in spite of having a slightly larger battery (1770 versus 1720mAh). The Action’s waterproof rating is up to 18 meters — eight more than the Hero. The GoPro bests DJI on resolution with 5.3K (60 fps) video versus 4K (both shoot up to 120fps in 4K, BTW). The displays are effectively the same. Both have a front-facing 1.4-inch display, while the DJI’s rear screen is 0.02 inches larger at 2.27 inches. The Osmo Action 4 is priced at $399. That’s a full $70 more than its predecessor, but it puts it in line with the GoPro’s reduced price (down from $499). At a glance, I’d say DJI’s got the edge here. The Action 4 is available starting today."
2023-08-02,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/hackerone-layoffs/,TechCrunch,HackerOne lays off 12% workforce as ‘one-time event’,"HackerOne, a widely known bug bounty and penetration testing platform, is cutting up to 12% of its workforce as the global economic slowdown continues to impact the tech community. The San Francisco-based startup announced its layoffs on Wednesday, TechCrunch learned and confirmed with the startup. The decision will impact the startup’s employees worldwide, including those in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Netherlands and other countries, HackerOne CEO Marten Mickos said in an email to employees, which was also posted to the company’s blog. “This comes as disappointing news, as we’ve all built strong connections with our fellow Hackeronies. These actions are necessary to be successful long-term,” said Mickos. “We’ve designed this reduction in force as a one-time event. We don’t claim to have perfect visibility into our future financial performance or the macroeconomic climate, but we unequivocally wanted to take a single action and move forward with confidence.” HackerOne has more than 450 employees globally. This suggests the layoffs will impact more than 50 employees. Mickos said the affected employees will receive severance packages including cash compensation and non-cash benefits. HackerOne said the company continued to hire new employees and invested in new products to expand its platform capabilities, but the products did not meet expectations and caused cost burdens, the executive noted. “HackerOne remains a category leader. We are one of the most important contributors to cybersecurity worldwide. We plan to be better, stronger, and faster when an improved business climate ultimately emerges,” Mickos said. HackerOne has raised close to $160 million since its inception in 2012, with the last funding of $49 million received in January last year. The startup counts GP Bullhound, New Enterprise Associates, Valor Equity Partners, EQT Ventures and Dragoneer Investment Group among its key investors. Moreover, it serves its bug bounty platform to entities including the U.S. Department of Defense, Google and Microsoft to help fix their vulnerabilities by connecting them with a worldwide community of security researchers."
2023-08-02,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/black-founders-funding-h1-2023/,TechCrunch,Commentary: The old guard in venture reigns supreme,"Black founders raised $212 million out of $29 billion this Q2, picking up just 0.71% of the capital allocated to U.S. founders this quarter, according to Crunchbase. In Q2 2022, Black founders raised $602 million out of $62 billion, or 0.97%, of the capital allocated. In total, Black founders raised around $565 million out of $75 billion in H1 2023, which is 0.75% of all capital raised in the U.S. so far this year. That, too, is a drop from the $1.8 billion out of $144 billion, or 1.25%, that they raised in H1 2022. Overall, funding to Black founders has gone down from previous years, but the overall amount of funding allocated has gone down, too. This isn’t surprising. Black founders have never raised more than 2% of capital in any given quarter, and the funding to them has been on a steady decline since the first quarter of 2022. Black founders picked up at least a billion in every quarter of 2021, momentum pushed forward by the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020. But quietly, attention has moved elsewhere, and the consistent decline in funding proves the waning investor interest. There seem to be two different worlds within the venture ecosystem. There is the old guard, the ones who have billions of assets under management, who operate in their bubble and rarely leave. Founders must go to them. Then there is the new guard, the emerging fund managers, many of whom are diverse, who are here to shake up the playbook. The problem is that they don’t have billions of AUM (assets under management), so even though their intentions are good, their checkbooks are dry. "

According to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, nearly 78% of all the U.S. iOS reviews of the newly renamed X app have been 1-star reviews since July 24th, the day of the official rebrand, compared with just 50% over the previous two weeks. (50% is still not a great number and one that speaks to other user complaints about the numerous changes Twitter has made under Musk’s ownership.) The new one-star reviews are in direct response to the rebrand, Sensor Tower notes, as users wrote how they’re upset with the new logo and name. “Bring back the BIRD,” writes one user. “GIVE US BACK THE BIRD!!!” shouts another. “What is X?,” asks a third reviewer. “Good app gone bad,” adds a fourth. “Ugly,” another complaint states, followed by one dubbing the new app a “dumpster fire,” and so on. However, the rebranding has not been all bad news for the company formerly known as Twitter. In fact, Sensor Tower’s data indicates that X’s worldwide installs grew 20% week-over-week in the wake of the rebranding. There was a related 3-4% increase in weekly user growth, as well. Earlier this month, X CEO Linda Yaccarino claimed the app usage was at an all-time high, and on July 28, X owner Elon Musk posted that monthly users had reached a new high this year. Neither exec was forthcoming with the exact dates and times that usage peaked, though. Despite the growth, Sensor Tower’s analysis revealed some troubling numbers, too. Per its panel, time spent per user fell 7% for the week, and daily sessions per user fell 6% following the renaming of the app to X. “Though Twitter usage and engagement typically display some volatility due to seasonality and the news cycle, some of the declines in engagement may be attributable to users’ frustration with changes to the app,” said Abe Yousef, Senior Insights Analyst at Sensor Tower. Of course, such a dramatic rebranding was likely to cause a backlash. Arguably, Twitter had not been a successful company under prior leadership, so there is some rationale behind giving the app a massive makeover and a new purpose.

Dear Sophie, I was accepted into a prestigious robotics engineering master’s program in the U.S. that begins in the fall! However, I heard the denial rate for F-1 student visas is increasing. Why?  How can I increase my chances of being approved? — Soon-to-Be Student Dear Soon-to-Be, Thank you for studying in the States! The U.S. needs and appreciates international students like you. This visa adjudication change will cost billions to the U.S. economy, and it’s a step backward with tech job vacancies growing and the swift rise of several emerging technologies. The United States is in critical need of international students like yourself to support our security and economy to remain competitive throughout this century. I’ve got lots of tips and strategies for you, but before I dive in, some good news: Earlier this week, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) held an additional random selection round — or lottery — among the H-1B registrations that were submitted but not selected in the March lottery to meet the annual cap of 85,000 H-1B visas. The USCIS has notified the additional 77,609 registrations that were selected. (The USCIS selected 110,791 registrations in March.) The second selection round could indicate that the number of cap-subject H-1B applications that the USCIS expected to receive by the June 30 deadline fell short of estimates, or, probably less likely, that the agency denied H-1B applications at a higher rate than expected. Decreased petitions would have likely stemmed from a combination of some continuing layoffs as well as the same candidates being entered into the lottery multiple times by separate companies, a change that the American Immigration Lawyers Association has proposed to DHS, which recently issued a brief response. The F-1 is a great way to learn and grow in the United States. Studying in the U.S. and completing your degree also offers the opportunity to work in your field through F-1 OPT (optional practical training) and STEM OPT, the two-year extension of OPT. Last month, robotics engineering and seven other fields of study, including institutional research and composite materials technology, were added to the STEM Designated Degree Program List, now making you eligible for STEM OPT! Now, about those declining F-1 approval rates — you’re correct: According to the Cato Institute, the denial rate for F-1 student visas jumped to an “unprecedented” 35% in 2022, compared to the 14% denial rate in all other nonimmigrant (temporary) visa categories, which include the H-1B specialty occupation visa and the O-1A extraordinary ability visa. Before 2021, F-1 student applications had a similar denial rate as other nonimmigrant visa applications. However, in 2021 and 2022, F-1 visas were denied at double the rate of all other nonimmigrant visas. Students can apply for an F-1 visa only after they have been accepted into an approved university program, so “[t]his means that the U.S. Department of State turned down 220,676 students who would have likely paid roughly $30,000 per year or $6.6 billion per year in tuition and living expenses,” writes David Bier, the author of the Cato Institute report. “Over four years, that number rises to $26.4 billion in lost economic benefits to the United States.” Let me dive into your questions, starting with the why. The State Department doesn’t specify the reasons for denying an F-1 visa. However, most consular officers deny nonimmigrant visas when you fail to prove in your visa interview that you have nonimmigrant intent, which means you only intend to remain in the U.S. temporarily and eventually plan to return to your home country.

2023-08-02,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/room-temperature-superconductors/,TechCrunch,What if room temperature superconductors were real?,"Hope springs eternal. For decades, there have been claims that researchers have created room-temperature superconductors. The materials promise to conduct an electric current with zero resistance while throwing off powerful magnetic fields. They’re a Holy Grail of materials science. Last week, a team from South Korea claimed to have created one — and not just a material that superconducts at ambient temperature, but one that does so at ambient pressure, too. Oh, and it’s made of relatively common materials, including lead, phosphorus and copper. The researchers published their findings on a preprint server. While not the gold standard in scientific publishing, it’s a decent first step that allows other experts to vet the claims. It’s still too early to tell whether their extraordinary claims will hold up, but some preliminary theoretical work suggests that they’re not out of the realm of possibility. Still, many researchers remain skeptical. But what if the claims were true? Myriad industries would be ripe for upheaval. Here are a few that would stand to gain the most. If scientists really have discovered a room-temperature superconductor, then last year’s surprise darling technology would be again catapulted into the headlines. The problem with fusion power hasn’t been whether it can be done, but whether it produces more power than the required equipment consumes. The National Ignition Facility’s experiment last winter proved that net-positive fusion power was more than just theoretically possible. "
2023-08-02,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/meta-starts-blocking-the-news-in-canada-its-latest-standoff-with-publishers/,TechCrunch,Meta starts blocking the news in Canada — its latest standoff with publishers,"Canadians using Facebook and Instagram should expect to see some gaps in their feeds, starting now. This week, Meta began blocking Canadian access to links and stories from news publishers — the company’s response to a bill that would require the tech giant to pay outlets for the right to distribute and profit from their content. “As we’ve always said, the law is based on a fundamentally flawed premise,” Meta policy communications director Andy Stone wrote on Twitter. “And, regrettably, the only way we can reasonably comply is to end news availability in Canada.” In June, Canadian Parliament passed the Online News Act, a law that forces tech platforms to negotiate with publishers in order to establish “fair revenue sharing” over their content. When those agreements don’t come willingly, the law — like its Australian counterpart — allows for mandatory arbitration as a “last resort” — an outcome that isn’t likely to look kindly on the tech half of things. On Tuesday, Meta announced that it has “begun the process of ending news availability in Canada.” All Facebook and Instagram users in Canada will eventually see the limits on news as the new policy rolls out in the coming weeks. The changes will apply to publishers themselves but also to users who share news and links. Google plans to follow suit with its own news blackout in search results over the law. With the legislation, Canadian lawmakers set out to bolster a news industry in decline, as shifts in advertising trends have lopsidedly rewarded online platforms at the expense of the competition. For more than a decade, tech platforms have reaped the benefits of publishers’ original content without having to pay for it, even as the news industry plunges into a disheartening death spiral that leaves it endangered. Tech companies, content to reap their rewards as the middlemen, have expressed little sympathy for the dying industry. After various experiments and gestures toward funding the news — a fairly transparent effort to stave off global legislation like the new Canadian law — Meta has more recently withdrawn from the conversation altogether. (Columbia’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism tallied up what we know about where Meta’s previous financial contributions to the news industry have gone, as the company does not maintain a public register of that information.) The era of Meta giving lip service to publishers may be at an end, with the company taking a very adversarial stance in Canada and supposedly backing away from news content in its Twitter clone, Threads. That situation follows a similar standoff in Australia in 2021, when Meta shut off news content in the country to protest the News Media Bargaining Code, which similarly forces tech platforms into compensation talks with publishers. Now two years in, Australia’s own standoff with companies like Meta and Google appears to have been a shot in the arm for local journalism, with $140 million in additional funding circulating each year. In Meta’s pivot, the company has resorted to disingenuously claiming that it doesn’t benefit from publishers’ content — a laughable statement considering the extent to which news and political content has driven engagement on Facebook. “We believe that news has a real social value. The problem is that it doesn’t have much of an economic value to Meta,” Rachel Curran, head of public policy for Meta Canada, claimed earlier this year. Critics of these laws make plenty of reasonable points. For one, the news industry is already overly reliant on social networks to drive traffic and spread stories, a dependence that these pieces of legislation would only worsen. The future of sustainable news likely depends on new solutions altogether — not deepening existing ties to mercurial tech giants. Other critics have pointed out how these forced negotiation frameworks may disproportionately advantage existing large media groups to the detriment of small and independent publishers. The laws are controversial — and may result in some awkward experiences for social media users — but ultimately the current arrangement disproportionately benefits tech companies, which happen to also be the ones crowing about being wronged this time. Like with the Australian legislation, how things play out in Canada will be a bellwether for future laws obligating social platforms to pay for their content, including one proposal on the table in California that’s on hold until 2024."
2023-08-02,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/x-formerly-twitter-streamlines-its-crowdsourced-fact-checking-system-community-notes/,TechCrunch,"X, formerly Twitter, streamlines its crowdsourced fact-checking system Community Notes","Elon Musk-owned X, the company formerly known as Twitter, is streamlining its crowdsourced fact-checking feature Community Notes. The feature historically has provided information to users about why they were seeing a fact check appended to a tweet, er, post. Now, after three years of development, the company says this extra context will be removed for those who are already experienced with Community Notes. In a post by X employee Lucas Neumann, he explains that Community Notes will evolve alongside people’s usage. As users become familiar with the feature, the company will remove the detailed explanations about how Notes work — though these will continue to appear for audiences new to Community Notes, he says. “When we first introduced @CommunityNotes, it was a very unfamiliar concept to most users. Understandably, people were naturally skeptical and had many questions when they encountered a note,” writes Neumann. “Our research consistently found that versions with more text, rather than less, helped people perceive notes as friendly, helpful, fair and trustworthy. It also helped them understand that these came from the community instead of company employees. My minimalist designer soul resisted these findings initially, but our research was solid, so we leaned on the side of text abundance,” he continues. “Now, after 3 years, as @CommunityNotes matures as a first-class feature and earns more people’s trust, we can finally start streamlining and refining it. We’re taking a ‘progressive onboarding’ approach: detailed explanations will continue to appear for audiences new to Community Notes, and where space permits, while streamlined versions will start showing to those with more experience,” Neumann says. The change is small and subtle, but one that speaks to the growing understanding among X’s user base of how the crowdsourced fact-checking process works. Launched to Twitter’s global users in December 2022 after earlier tests, the feature previously known as Birdwatch has been refined over the years so the “wisdom of the crowds,” so to speak, couldn’t be easily gamed by someone or a group of people wanting to spread misinformation. The system is not as simple as having a post or fact check upvoted or downvoted for accuracy. If that were the case, brigades of like-minded contributors could team up to promote their own viewpoints. Instead, Community Notes uses a “bridging” algorithm that attempts to find consensus among people who don’t usually share the same views. Not everyone can immediately become a contributor to Community Notes, either. They first have to prove they’re capable of writing helpful “notes” by correctly assessing other notes as either Helpful or Not Helpful, which earns them points. Once reaching contributor status, users must then continue to add quality contributions or they will have their contributor status removed. The Community Notes also can’t be edited or modified by X’s team members and don’t represent the company’s official viewpoint, the company explains on its website. Musk, in particular, felt strongly about Community Notes, after having been highly critical of Twitter’s former content moderation efforts before he took ownership. “Community Notes is a gamechanger for improving accuracy on Twitter!,” Musk tweeted last year. While originally designed to provide additional context for tweets that didn’t technically violate Twitter’s rules, but could be misleading or lacking critical context, Community Notes play a larger role on the new X as the company’s employee headcount, including in trust and safety and moderation, has declined through layoffs. Though other areas of the old Twitter have been cut or revamped — from subscriptions to newsletters to the status of third-party clients — Community Notes appear to be the focus of continued development."
2023-08-02,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/mondee-data-exposed-credit-cards-flight-itineraries/,TechCrunch,Mondee security lapse exposed flight itineraries and unencrypted credit card numbers,"Travel giant Mondee has secured an exposed database that was spilling sensitive customer information, including detailed flight and hotel itineraries and unencrypted credit card numbers. Anurag Sen, a good-faith security researcher known for discovering inadvertently exposed data on the internet, found the database and shared details with TechCrunch to alert the company. According to Sen, the database was exposed to the internet without a password, allowing anyone to access the sensitive data inside using a web browser, just with its IP address. TechCrunch found that the database was also accessible from an easily guessable subdomain of a Mondee subsidiary’s website. Much of the data appears to relate to Mondee subsidiary TripPro, a travel agent platform used by tens of thousands of booking agents and travel startups allowing self-service flight ticketing and hotel booking. The database, hosted on Oracle’s cloud and more than 1.7 terabytes in size at the time it was exposed, contained customer’s personal information, including names, gender, dates of birth, home addresses, flight information and passport numbers. Some of the data seen by TechCrunch includes full customer passenger name records, or PNR, including ticket and booking details. TechCrunch has also seen customers’ full credit card numbers and expiry dates in the database, but none of the data was encrypted. TechCrunch verified that the exposed data matches real people’s information. One person we spoke to confirmed their flight information was accurate and said they booked their flights through a popular booking site. The database also contained non-customer testing data generated by Mondee developers. The database was first spotted as exposed in late-July, according to a listing on Shodan, a search engine that crawls the web for exposed servers and databases. The circumstances of how the database became publicly accessible are not known, though database exposures are often misconfigurations caused by human error. When reached by email, Mondee spokesperson Karen Gillo did not acknowledge the incident or provide comment. The database became inaccessible a short time after TechCrunch contacted Mondee. It is not yet known if anyone other than Sen found the exposed database during the window it was accessible from the internet. TechCrunch asked Mondee if the company has the technical ability, such as logs, to determine what, if any, data was accessed or exfiltrated from the database. Mondee did not say if it plans to notify affected customers of this data exposure. Read more on TechCrunch:"
2023-08-02,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/apple-cards-savings-account-reaches-over-10-billion-in-deposits/,TechCrunch,Apple Card’s Savings account reaches over $10B in deposits,"Apple announced today that Apple Card’s high-yield Savings account offered by Goldman Sachs has reached over $10 billion in deposits from users since launching in April. The Savings account offers an APY (annual percentage yield) of 4.15%. Since launch, 97% of Savings customers have chosen to have their Daily Cash automatically deposited into their account, the company says. Apple notes that there is no limit on how much Daily Cash users can earn, and to build on their savings even further, users can deposit additional funds into their Savings account through a linked bank account, or from their Apple Cash balance. Savings accounts are technically managed by Goldman Sachs, which means that balances are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). When customers pay with their Apple Card, they get cash back on all purchases. By default, all purchases grant you 1% in cash rewards and 2% for all purchases made using Apple Pay. Purchases with select merchants unlock 3% in rewards. “With each of the financial products we’ve introduced, we’ve sought to reinvent the category with our users’ financial health in mind,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, in a statement. “That was our goal with the launch of Apple Card four years ago, and it remained our guiding principle with the launch of Savings. With no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements, Savings provides an easy way for users to save money every day, and we’re thrilled to see the excellent reception from customers both new and existing.” “We are very pleased with the success of the Savings account as we continue to deliver seamless, valuable products to Apple Card customers, with a shared focus on creating a best-in-class customer experience that helps consumers lead healthier financial lives,” said Liz Martin, Goldman Sachs’ head of Enterprise Partnerships, in a statement. Users can set up and manage their Savings account directly from Apple Card in the Wallet app. To get started, after accessing Apple Card from the Wallet app, users can tap “More,” select “Daily Cash,” tap “Set Up Savings,” and follow the onscreen instructions. Once the account is set up, users will also have access to a Savings dashboard in the Wallet app where they can track their account balance and interest earned over time."

Known for clever marketing schemes that won over sporty lesbians, dog-loving dinks, outdoorsy families and Crocodile Dundee fans alike, the Japanese automaker has so far lagged behind the competition as far is its electrification plans go. The firm was late to the party with the launch of its first EV — the 2023 Solterra crossover. Subaru says it’s ready to get serious. At least, that’s what the conglomerate told investors today. Subaru upped its EV sales goals on Wednesday during its quarterly earnings report. It now aims to sell 600,000 EVs per year by 2030 — a milestone that would make up roughly half of the firm’s global sales. Most of these sales will come from the U.S., Subaru’s biggest market. The automaker also said it would boost its planned battery-electric lineup to eight models. Earlier this year, Subaru announced that would up its electric-vehicle lineup to four vehicles by 2026, and now the conglomerate plans to double that lineup by the end of 2028. In the mix is a three-row electric SUV, which Toyota will reportedly build for Subaru in Kentucky starting in 2025, according to Automotive News. Subaru added that it plans to back up these announcements by investing around $10.5 billion (1.5 trillion yen) toward its electrification efforts “by around 2030.”"
2023-08-02,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/ico-meta-warning/,TechCrunch,UK privacy watchdog warns Meta over plan to keep denying Brits a choice over its ad tracking,"The U.K.’s data protection watchdog has responded to Meta’s announcement yesterday that it intends to offer (other) Europeans a free choice to deny its tracking-for-ad-targeting but won’t be asking U.K. users for their consent to its surveillance — with some, er, pointed remarks. Take it away, Stephen Almond, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)’s executive director of regulatory risk, with this “ICO statement on Meta“: Almond’s carefully worded remarks (“close attention”; “assessing what this means for information rights of people in the UK”, “considering an appropriate response”) suggest the regulator is not pleased that the adtech giant formerly known as Facebook isn’t intending to give U.K. users the same level of respect for their data rights as people in the EU, European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland are, apparently, set to get soon. Simply put, it looks very awkward indeed for the ICO, and terrible news for U.K. users stuck in their post-Brexit not-so-sunny-uplands, that Meta has calculated it doesn’t have to offer the same degree of respect for their information as it must for Europeans living elsewhere in the region. Especially since Meta is doing this at a time when U.K. data protection law is still based on the pan-EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). (I mean, the U.K. government’s plan to water down the domestic privacy regime, via touted post-Brexit data “reforms,” hasn’t even made it onto the statute books yet! So, on paper, the privacy regime is the same as it was when the U.K. was in the EU.) The specific issue the ICO is facing up to here is that defense of domestic data protection rules now falls squarely on its shoulders — with no protective shielding from the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) handing down the last word on how the law must be enforced. Since January 31, 2020, when Brexit was fully enacted by the U.K. government, rulings made by the CJEU don’t apply in U.K. law. And, notably, Meta has only been moved to — finally — announce its intention to give Europeans a choice to deny its tracking-for-ads in the wake of a major CJEU ruling last month. That also followed a significant January 2023 GDPR enforcement by EU data protection regulators. And an emergency intervention by Norway last month banning Meta’s behavioral ads locally over the legal basis issue — rather than waiting for Ireland, Meta’s lead regulator, to do it across the whole EU. The cumulative impact of all these EU procedures has left the tech giant with no lawful basis left to claim under EU law for the data processing it carries out to “personalize” ads — except consent. So there is now momentum behind GDPR enforcement that is having a tangible impact on reforming privacy-hostile business models. But, sadly for people in the U.K., it sits outside the EU’s implementation of GDPR. And so . . . no Meta consent intent for Brits! The bloc also hasn’t stood still on lawmaking since the U.K. up and left. It’s actually been highly active on digital regulations, including undertaking a major piece of ex ante competition reform, called the Digital Markets Act — which also appears to be giving Meta pause for thought on its ads data processing. The company’s blog post update yesterday announcing its intention to switch to consent for ads data processing in the EU referenced “a number of evolving and emerging regulatory requirements in the region, notably how our lead data protection regulator in the EU, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), is now interpreting GDPR in light of recent legal rulings, as well as anticipating the entry into force of the Digital Markets Act (DMA)” as informing its decision. And, well, the DMA doesn’t apply in the U.K. either. Just as the Irish DPC’s GDPR enforcement and the CJEU’s interpretation of how to apply the GDPR don’t. Meta switched U.K. users’ data from falling under its Irish subsidiary to its U.S. entity earlier this year, taking U.K. users firmly out of EU jurisdiction. That’s Brexit, folks!  (A “Made in the U.K.” digital ex ante competition reform also hasn’t made it into domestic law after facing delays as a result of political turmoil in the governing Conservative party in the wake of, er, Brexit. . . . So there’s no U.K. equivalent to the DMA yet either.) The even more particular problem for the ICO is it has systematically failed to act on similar complaints about adtech tracking lacking a proper lawful basis for — literally — years. It was actually sued for inaction back in 2020 over just such a complaint. And even paused its investigation into adtech entirely during the pandemic, saying it didn’t want to saddle the industry with “undue pressure” at such a difficult time. What about U.K. users’ rights not to be unlawfully creeped on by advertisers during COVID-19? The ICO evidently didn’t feel it should press the industry to care about such details back then — or, well, ever since really. So it’s a bit rich for the ICO to suddenly square up to Meta with implicit concerns that Brits’ info rights aren’t being properly respected. Unless this is the regulator’s Damascene conversion moment — on the need to actually enforce against adtech abuses it has been publicly critical of for years. Previously the U.K. regulator has considered an “appropriate response” to rampant lawbreaking by the adtech industry to mean convening a few roundtables where advertising execs were seemingly able to fill the room with hot air about respect for compliance while being allowed to continue lucrative data-mining business as usual as the ICO continued “investigating.” So it’s not clear what action the U.K. regulator might deem “appropriate” to take against Meta if it keeps trampling local users’ rights to deny its tracking. Hopefully we’re not going to see another open-ended/never-ending investigation. Technically the U.K. GDPR allows for penalties for confirmed breaches that can reach as high as 4% of global annual turnover — which, in Meta’s case, could sum to a few billion pounds. But the ICO hasn’t strayed anywhere near the theoretical maximums in the GDPR enforcements it has chalked up to date. So the adtech giant may have decided there’s minimum regulatory risk on U.K. turf — and set the level of respect for local users’ data accordingly. Ergo: No consent for you, you’re British. We reached out to the ICO with questions about its historical lack of enforce against adtech’s tracking and profiling, and to ask what specific responses it may consider if Meta continues to provide U.K. users with a lesser level of data protection than other people in the EU, but the regulator told us it had nothing more to add beyond Almond’s public remarks. Meta also declined comment on the ICO’s statement. But its spokesman pointed us back to the section of its blog post we quoted above — where it says its intention to switch to consent in the EU and EEA was taken in response to a number of enforcement decisions by the region’s regulators and courts. So, basically, Meta is making the salient point that its looming switch of lawful basis tracks enforcement action. No enforcement, no switch. Simples! Of course, this also means the ICO does have the power to change how U.K. users’ rights are treated by Meta or any other adtech entities operating on U.K. soil — that is, by actually enforcing U.K. law on the adtech industry as privacy campaigners have been calling for it to do for years. Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights at the University College London, who was one of the individuals behind the aforementioned complaint about adtech industry practices to the ICO back in 2018 — and who also subsequently took legal action after the regulator closed the complaint a couple of years later without taking a decision — urged the ICO to seize the opportunity it now has to act on its stated concerns for U.K. users’ rights by regulating adtech giants like Meta directly. “Since Meta moved its relevant headquarters for U.K. users from Ireland to the U.S., the U.K. is now obliged to regulate the tech firm for itself, not to wait for Ireland. This would be a great time [for the ICO] to show it is ready for these significant new responsibilities,” Veale told TechCrunch. “The text of the relevant law applying to Meta is in all relevant ways identical in the EU and the U.K. Meta’s choice not to extend the same rights to U.K. users is it making a calculated decision that privacy enforcement in the U.K. is weak enough to ignore,” Veale added. “Some of the court judgements do apply to the EU and not the U.K., as they were handed down after the end of 2020. But that does not mean that the regulator cannot take clear action using the information provided in the course of these judgements, and on the solid reasoning within them.”"

But if we’re being honest, these Pitch Deck Teardowns are a bit of a performance. It’s edu-tainment: Yes, you learn something about some of the things that work and don’t work about a deck, but you don’t learn everything. As a consultant, I work with VC firms, accelerators and startups to build pitch stories for startups raising money, using an in-depth rubric to ensure that companies have crossed every T and dotted every I. To every other pitch coach: You’re one TC+ subscription away from learning how I work. You’re welcome. Here are the 21 things I check when I evaluate a pitch deck. Note: Each item on this list doesn’t necessarily mean a slide. Some parts of the story can be told as part of other slides or be inferred from context, but one way or another, I usually advise that these elements be present in a story. If they are absent, I consider whether there is a good reason for not including them — for example, whether that part of the story is glaringly obvious, not as relevant for the company, or perhaps something that the company doesn’t have clarity on at this stage. Any issues that you see in this section are very serious. You’ve got to nail these parts of the story in order to raise VC funding. Is it venture scale?: Can your product give potential investors a venture-scale return? Team: Do you have good founder-market fit? Can you hire a good team for your company? Market: Is the market big enough? Can you reasonably obtain the market share you need? Traction: This is your chance to show how you measure the success of your business, and how it’s going. Does it include vanity metrics? If the company doesn’t have revenue yet, how are you thinking about risk in the business? The Ask: Are you raising enough money to reach your goals, but staying within a reasonable amount for the current stage of the business? Use of funds: If you hit your goals, will you be able to raise your next round of funding? Problem: Are you clearly outlining the problem you are solving, and is it a problem worth solving? Any problems in this section may raise suspicion or result in more intense due diligence, but you’ll probably be able to raise anyway. Maybe. Operating plan: Your pitch in numbers. How will you execute and build your KPIs (key performance indicators) for this funding round? Competition: Outline your competitors. How are you different enough to take on the market/win their customers? Business model: How does your startup make money, and what is the cost of acquiring customers? Go-to-market: Who are your customers, now and in the future, and how are you going to reach them? Solution: What’s the broad solution you are building to solve the problem you’ve outlined in your slide deck? Product: How are you implementing the solution? Resist the temptation to go into too much detail. Good enough is often good enough, but these pieces can help tell a more comprehensive story. Summary: Does the deck have a good summary early or toward the end of the deck? Pricing: This is closely related to the business model. Does the company explain how it charges for its products?  "

However, building successful companies will require a specialized focus from investors — not just in providing capital but also in operational prowess that’s as unique and forward-thinking as the generative AI industry itself. Last week, we announced the first dedicated seed vehicle in our history, the $250 million Mayfield AI Start, which will support founders starting at day zero. As we meet with many AI-native founders, here are the top five pieces of company-building advice we’re sharing with them. Paradigm shifts propel the rebuilding of the technology stack, creating new enduring companies in every era. For instance, Oracle rose to prominence as the PC era enterprise software provider, but in the cloud era, Salesforce and the SaaS model became a viable alternative. Intel dominated as the chip king in the PC era but mobile customers preferred ARM (Advanced RISC Machine), which is now being displaced by RISC-V today.

			As we meet with many AI-native founders, here are the top five pieces of company-building advice we’re sharing with them.


The AI era has already created leaders like Nvidia on the chip front and is giving rise to emerging leaders like open source AI model community Hugging Face (similar to GitHub in the cloud age) and foundational model platform OpenAI, whose ChatGPT is being compared to the Netscape browser moment of the web era. So we are encouraging AI-first founders to think big about how they will become an independent company that dominates a layer of the new technology stack.

But it is important to identify what innovation bet a founder is making and frame it as a painkiller, not a vitamin for the specific persona they are targeting. Some questions we are encouraging founders to ask include: "
2023-08-02,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/googles-generative-search-feature-now-shows-related-videos-and-images/,TechCrunch,Google’s generative search feature now shows related videos and images,"Google is adding contextual images and videos to its AI-powered Search Generative Experiment (SGE), the generative AI-powered search feature announced at May’s I/O conference. Later in the month, the company made the feature available to select users who signed up for the experiment through Google Labs. With the updates, SGE now shows images or videos related to the search query. For instance, if you are looking for “tiniest birds of prey” or “how to remove marble stains,” you will see pictures of birds or videos related to stain removal directly in the generative search suggestion box. Google said that it is also now showing the date of publishing for links that are suggested by SGE.  “To help you better understand how recent the information is from these web pages, we recently added publish dates to each link. And we’re continuing to experiment with new, easier ways for people to find web pages that support information in AI overviews,” the company said. The search giant added that it recently made performance improvements so that users can quickly get AI-powered results. Users can sign up to test these new AI-powered search features through Search Labs and later access them through the Google app on iOS and Android or through Chrome on desktop. Google is trying its hand at generative AI through different products. Its chatbot, Bard, recently launched in the EU and extended support to 40 languages. The company has also rolled out multiple AI-powered features across Workspace tools. Google has also brought generative AI to enterprise solutions. Earlier this week, Axios reported that Google Assistant will also pivot to accommodate generative AI."

Say you are planning a trip to Japan and you are currently reading a related blog post. When you tap the address bar, you will then see the usual list of your favorite sites and recent searches and underneath that a list of suggested searches. It’s essentially Google Search autocomplete without having to type anything. This new feature is coming to Chrome and iOS and Android and rolling out now. Image Credits: Google Another change, though one that’ll come to Chrome on Android first, is that when you open up a new tab now, you will see a list of trending searches — and initiate a search for these trending topics from there, of course. As part of Google Trends, the company already highlights these trends on the web today, though by making it a core feature of the new tab page on Chrome mobile, it’ll reach a far wider audience.  Image Credits: Google Google is also tweaking its “touch to search” feature on Android with this update. As before, you can select a word (or words) on any page and have the usual context menu pop up that lets you initiate a search based on what you’ve selected. Now, however, Google will also automatically pop up a carousel with related searches at the bottom of the screen. Image Credits: Google And there is more: Now, you’ll see 10 search suggestions when you start typing in the Chrome mobile address bar instead of six. That’s not a huge difference, but as with all of these updates, Google wants you to search more (and see more search ads in the process, of course). Image Credits: Google    "
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/elon-musk-owned-x-renames-tweetdeck-to-xpro/,TechCrunch,Elon Musk-owned X renames TweetDeck to XPro,"Elon Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter, has renamed TweetDeck to XPro in an ongoing rebranding exercise of the social media service. The company has adopted the @Pro handle instead of @TweetDeck for the tool. However, many parts of the tool, including the help page, still have “Twitter” and “TweetDeck” mentions. The renaming is not surprising given Musk had hinted about the change last week. At that time, he had added that XPro will come with “a wide range of psy op plugins.” As it is the case with many of Musk’s posts, there were no details about what kind of plug-ins those might be. Early last month, after many users were unable to access parts of TweetDeck, the company started pushing them to the new version of the tool. Later, it also announced that in 30 days, only verified users would be able to access TweetDeck. Since this announcement was made on July 4, X will expectedly make XPro/TweetDeck a paid-only feature in the next few days. Musk & Co. has been busy with the site’s rebranding, but it hasn’t been smooth sailing. The company took over the @x handle from the previous owner without any compensation or prior notice. Additionally, Apple seemingly granted an exception to the social media company to use a single character as the app name. Typically, the iPhone maker prohibits developers from using a single-character app name on the App Store. The Musk-owned company was also asked to remove the flashing “X” sign from its office building after The San Francisco Department of Building Inspection received complaints about it over the weekend."
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/shadowfax-newquest/,TechCrunch,Flipkart-backed Shadowfax nears $60M funding led by TPG NewQuest,"Indian logistics startup Shadowfax is finalizing a funding round of about $60 million, more than a year after it began the funding deliberations, two sources familiar with the matter said. TPG NewQuest is positioning to lead the round, which also includes some secondary transactions, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the deliberations are private. The Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which counts Flipkart among its backers, earlier engaged with A91 Partners for the funding but the talks didn’t materialize over valuation mismatch, the sources said. Indian daily Economic Times earlier reported about the A91 Partners talks. A deal with NewQuest could close as soon as this month, the sources said. Shadowfax didn’t respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The startup, one of the largest logistics service providers to hyper-local, on-demand delivery businesses, has significantly pared its reliance on its largest customer, Meesho, in recent months and has been profitable for at least the past three months, the sources said. Its over-reliance on Meesho was a source of concern among many of its investors, people familiar with the matter said. Shadowfax counts Myntra, Zomato-owned Blinkit, Decathlon, Flipkart, BigBasket and Practo among its customers. The startup’s losistics network reaches over 15,000 zip codes across India, and it works with over 3 million delivery personnel and processes 1.5 million orders a day, according to its website. TPG NewQuest declined to comment. Shadowfax has raised about $121 million over the years."
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/x-twitter-paid-users-hide-checkmarks/,TechCrunch,"X, formerly Twitter, now lets paid users hide their checkmarks","Social media company X, formerly Twitter, now lets paid users hide their verification checkmarks. The Elon Musk-owned company introduced paid verification last year with the Twitter Blue relaunch. The service was renamed to XBlue during the ongoing rebranding exercise. The company has updated the help page for paid subscriptions, which is titled “About Twitter Blue,” saying that even if you hide the checkmark it might be visible in some places. The company didn’t give any further details about those placeholders. “As a subscriber, you can choose to hide your checkmark on your account. The check mark will be hidden on your profile and posts. The checkmark may still appear in some places and some features could still reveal you have an active subscription. Some features may not be available while your checkmark is hidden. We will continue to evolve this feature to make it better for you,” the page reads. This will supposedly help users benefit from subscription features without showing that they are a verified account. The option to hide the checkmark will show up in the “Profile customization” section of account settings. Image Credits: X/Twitter In March, app reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi noted that Twitter is working on a feature to hide checkmarks with ID verification. There was a lot of uproar about paid verification as it was hard to distinguish between legacy-verified accounts of notable people and users who had paid for the checkmark. In April, Twitter removed legacy checkmarks, but later it reinstated the checkmark for top accounts — even if they didn’t pay for it. Since the relaunch, the company has introduced features like a 10,000-character limit for posts, a three-hour video upload limit, fewer ads on the timeline and, most recently, ad revenue sharing for subscribed users in order to incentivize people to post more on the platform. In May, the platform also enabled features like encrypted DMs for verified users."
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/as-spend-management-space-heats-up-brex-and-rho-turn-to-ai-startups-to-help-power-new-products/,TechCrunch,"As spend management space heats up, Brex and Rho turn to AI startups to help power new products","The competition in the spend management space continues to intensify. Brex and Rho today each announced AI-powered/enabled accounts payables offerings. Their announcements coincidentally came out the same day competitor Ramp announced it had expanded into procurement — further evidence that the companies in the space are clamoring to not only meet customer demand but presumably attempt to outdo each other in terms of what they can offer their customers to help control spend. Specifically, Brex today revealed Payables, its AI-enabled Accounts Payable (AP) offering, while Rho announced new AI-powered Accounts Payable automation capabilities. Brex’s offering is live today while Rho said its new capabilities will be live later this month. Via email, Brex co-CEO and co-founder Henrique Dubugras told TechCrunch that launching the new product had been “in the works” since the startup started building Empower, its spend management platform, over a year ago. He noted that while Brex has used artificial intelligence for years in various capacities such as customer support and underwriting, what is new now is that it partnered with “multiple” machine learning companies such as Scale AI and Photon “to drive the highest accuracy of information extracted from invoices.” Prior to this launch, Dubugras said that Brex offered a lighter version of bill pay that gave customers the ability to send scheduled and recurring payments. Now, he said they will “have even more advanced spend controls with multi-level approvals.”  For its part, Rho said it is offering AI-powered invoice and bill processing to its clients. Specifically, invoices sent to a designated AP inbox will “undergo automatic digitization” powered by generative AI technology. In a statement, the company said the process “transforms the invoice into a bill and creates a corresponding liability in the client’s integrated ERP system. Clients can then authorize bill payments through Rho one by one or in bulk, with liabilities automatically marked as paid in the ERP.” Rho CEO Everett Cook told TechCrunch via email that the new capabilities had been in the works for nearly a year, building on the company’s initial accounts payable release in 2021. Rho has partnered with OpenAI — a portfolio company of Rho investor DFJ Growth. With the new product, he claims, customers will be able to “configure one-click workflows that help finance teams process thousands of payables in seconds.” “Our position on generative AI is that it is only useful if it is grounded in tangible business value,” said Rishav Chopra, SVP of product & design at Rho.  Besides wanting to better compete, both Brex and Rho expect their new offerings to increase revenue for their respective companies.  Dubugras said the new payables product should increase the percentage of customers’ spend processed via Brex. “As a result, some of that spend will be on their Brex card, one way in which Brex earns revenue,” he told TechCrunch. “Plus, using a Brex business account for bill pay, another way in which Brex earns revenue, allows customers to send payments faster, eliminating ACH delays while also earning passive yield.” Brex claims that it is unique relative to other companies in the market in that it is “the only player” with its own business account that can earn revenue in this way, allowing the company to offer payables for free. (TechCrunch has not independently verified this claim.) Meanwhile, Rho’s Cook believes that while the “timing is pretty coincidental” with Brex’s announcement, he supposes each of their customers were telling them “the same things” — that “they’re fed up with their legacy AP providers and want a modern solution that’s directly integrated with the rest of their finance stack.” Legacy providers include the likes of Bill.com and Concur. Dubugras believes there is a lot of competition in the space for a very good reason, telling TechCrunch: “The spend management space is very dynamic and that is because the opportunity is so large across SaaS and payments. Beyond the noise there is still a lot of differentiation between the players.” Rho’s Chopra also believes that the current macro environment has led to increased pressures on the part of CFOs and finance teams “to move faster than ever and operate leaner.” This in turn has — for obvious reasons — created more demand for spend management products.

2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/california-privacy-agency-connected-cars/,TechCrunch,This California agency wants to know what happens to all that connected car data,"The troves of data collected by today’s modern connected cars has long been viewed as a cash cow — a yet untapped opportunity that could boost profits for automakers. Now one California agency wants to know exactly how that data might be used. The California Privacy Protection Agency announced plans this week to review the data privacy practices of automakers that make and sell connected vehicles embedded with all kinds of data-mining features, from cameras and location sharing to web-based entertainment and smartphone integration. “Modern vehicles are effectively connected computers on wheels. They’re able to collect a wealth of information via built-in apps, sensors, and cameras, which can monitor people both inside and near the vehicle,” CPPA executive director Ashkan Soltani said in a statement. The aim, Soltani said, is “to understand how these companies are complying with California law when they collect and use consumers’ data.” The CPPA’s review is a first in the United States, where automakers have enjoyed a more lax data privacy environment compared to Europe. But that could soon change, at least in states that have passed data privacy laws like California, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah and soon Virginia. So far, California is the first to conduct a review of how automakers use connected car data, an action that aligns with the state’s lead in data privacy laws. The Agency is conducting this review under the California Consumer Privacy Act, a law adopted in 2018 that gives individuals in the state the right to know the personal information collected about them by businesses, the right to delete that information and the right to stop its sale or sharing. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about the downside of connected cars for years because these vehicles often automatically gather consumers’ locations, personal preferences and other details about their daily lives. Those concerns have grown as automakers have stepped up their software game in a bid to catch up with Tesla. Today, a new 2023 model year vehicle likely has an infotainment system with an array of third-party apps as well as cameras, including one facing the driver as part of its advanced driver assistance system. A growing number of vehicles have “Google built-in,” software based on the company’s Android operating system that has been adapted for automotive and integrates all of Google’s app directly into the vehicle. The agency said California has more than 35 million vehicles registered in the state. That’s not counting the millions more registered in other states that are on California roads. This saturation of connected cars has implications even for individuals who don’t own the vehicle, including ride-hailing customers and even pedestrians. Internet-connected vehicles produce huge amounts of data when driven, data which is then shared with manufacturers and held for years under privacy policies that allow vast and near-unrestricted use of the data they collect. Manufacturers can share or sell that information with data brokers, which when combined with web browsing and phone data can be used to profile users for targeted advertising. Collecting huge amounts of vehicle data also makes it obtainable by law enforcement agencies, which can demand vehicle data from in-car entertainment systems, collected by car manufacturers, and used for tracking and surveillance. Google noted in a statement provided to TechCrunch that it does not have access to any vehicle data unless automakers choose to license Google products. “In all instances data is used in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy,” the company said, providing a link to that policy. “Drivers also have the option to change privacy settings for Google apps and services at any time. This extends to what is shared with third parties.” GM pointed TechCrunch to its policy as well, noting that it is committed to protecting customers’ personal information. “GM takes data privacy seriously and is committed to safeguarding personal information,” the company said in an emailed statement. “For every GM vehicle, the vehicle owner must accept GM’s User Terms and Privacy Statement to use these products and services. These documents detail our data practices and are available online for consumers to review.”"
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/why-the-all-electric-volvo-ex30-is-such-a-big-deal/,TechCrunch,Why the all-electric Volvo EX30 is such a big deal,"Almost a decade ago, Volvo drove into the modern era by going big. Literally. The second-generation XC90 crossover that launched in 2015 helped reset a brand associated with boxy station wagons by offering innovative hybrid engines, striking styling and a big tablet center screen that felt right out of the Tesla playbook. Now, the car that’s poised to be Volvo’s next big hit is actually pretty small — and affordable, too. The EX30, which recently made its North American debut in New York, is a car full of firsts. Volvo’s first compact fully electric crossover is its quickest car ever and is outfitted with an innovative, yet cheaper interior made with sustainable materials — a combination the automaker believes is key to turning the EX30 into a mass-volume, mainstream success. In short, this small car is a big deal for Volvo and a major evolution of the brand. And it’s already making a huge splash. “The overall reception has been exceeding expectations, multiple times,” David Mele, the EX30’s product manager in the United States, said in an interview. “It’s been remarkably positive. We’re seeing that basically, every market that Volvo operates in is really excited about this car.” Image Credits: Volvo A major reason is the EX30’s price tag: It starts at $34,950, instantly making it one of the more affordable EV options in the United States. In a year when electric adoption has seen some ups and downs — some critics worry demand is slowing as EVs pile up on dealer lots — the EX30 will come in well below the average $53,000 price tag these cars command lately. Very few players exist in America’s affordable EV space right now: There’s the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, selling like crazy after price cuts and tax rebates; the Chevrolet Bolt, which General Motors reversed course on discontinuing; and a handful of others, like the Kia Niro EV and Hyundai Kona EV and Hyundai Kona Electric. The latter two can easily cross into the $40,000 range at dealer lots. It’s not that most people aren’t interested in EVs, analysts say, but that they’re turned off by their prices at a time when interest rates are high and the economy faces uncertainty ahead. Data firm AutoPacific found in a recent survey that a price tag below $35,000 is what it would take for many people to flip the switch. The EX30’s right in that sweet spot, undercutting even Volvo’s next-cheapest car, the compact gas or electric XC40, by a few thousand dollars. The EX30 is about 10 inches smaller than the XC40 and 20 inches smaller than Tesla’s world-beating Model Y crossover. Previous attempts at compact cars haven’t always gone great for Volvo. Today, its top-selling models in the U.S. are the midsize XC60, followed by the bigger XC90. Past entrants like the compact C30 hatchback and V50 never made a big sales splash, either. In a lot of ways, the EX30 is risky, but Volvo is banking on that electric powertrain to attract customers it wouldn’t have had before. Mele said the target EX30 customer is “pre-family” buyers without kids or even “post-family” parents and grandparents. It could be a lot of buyers’ second or third car, or their first EV, and their first Volvo. That’s… a lot of people. In short, Volvo’s going for mass appeal on this one — something it hasn’t really gone in for terribly often before. “It’s not going to be a niche product,” Mele said. (He declined to discuss sales targets for the EX30.) Scale fits with Volvo’s goals of going “half-electric” by 2025 and all-electric by 2030, Mele said. But it’s also a key part of initiatives driven by Volvo’s Chinese parent company, Geely Holding Group. Between Volvo, the more performance-focused Polestar, the British sports car maker Lotus and several EV-focused brands not sold in America like Lynk & Co, Geely is increasingly rising as the Chinese auto conglomerate looking to take over the world — perhaps even without its customers realizing it. In fact, like just a handful of other cars sold in the U.S. these days, the EX30 will be made in China. That means it won’t be eligible for any U.S. tax credits and that it’s subject to a 27.5% tariff on Chinese-made vehicles — making that price tag even more impressive. (“Anything we have to pay to the government is accounted for in that price,” Mele said, declining to speak on the potential profitability of the car.) Mele said Volvo is still evaluating where the car will be built over the long term. While Volvo won’t say anything further officially, it’s plausible that the company could decide to follow the moves of several competitors and put production somewhere in North America. Volvo is already expanding its South Carolina plant to build its flagship EX90 electric crossover. “Our goal, long term, is to build cars where we sell,” Mele said. “That’s both just good from a manufacturing perspective but also cuts down on carbon emissions.” Other markets aren’t as aggressive on China tariffs, of course. But at a time when European automakers are deeply concerned about lower-cost Chinese cars eating their market share on their home turfs, Volvo is one European brand that could have its kladdkaka and eat it too. Image Credits: Patrick George While Americans have historically been wary of Chinese-made, cars given past perceptions and political tensions, the EX30 could be enough of a deal that it will test just how much we care; the long-held Swedish brand identity might help. The EX30 offers two battery packs: a 69 kWh nickel-cobalt-manganese unit for North America, and a cheaper, lower-range 51 kWh lithium-iron-phosphate unit for other markets. The EX30 has two powertrain setups. The base model is a single-motor, rear-wheel drive car boasting 272 horsepower and 275 miles of range. That model does zero to 60 mph in a respectable 5.7 seconds. Upgrading to the Twin Motor Performance variant gets dual motors for all-wheel-drive and 422 horsepower, plus a zero to 60 mph time of just 3.4 seconds. No Volvo has ever been that quick from the factory, the company says. Its 12.3-inch vertical touchscreen, which runs almost all major control interfaces as there’s nothing in front of the driver, much like a Tesla, runs the latest version of Google’s Android operating system. Wireless Apple CarPlay is also standard, as is wireless phone charging, standard 5G connectivity, over-the-air software updates, four USB-C ports, and what Volvo says is the ability to fast-charge from 10% to 80% in 26.5 minutes. In other words, while it’s small and affordable, it doesn’t seem like some penalty box economy car. And it comes in some fun colors, like Cloud Blue or the especially daring (for Volvo, anyway) Moss Yellow. The EX30 is expected to go on sale next summer. And while Mele confirmed the EX30 will launch with the standard CCS charging port, Volvo’s models will be able to access Tesla’s Supercharger network with an adapter in 2024, and that plug will be standard from 2025 onward, which could make it even more enticing as someone’s “first EV.” Mele said that’s exactly the goal. “With this car, we’re sort of democratizing battery electric vehicles,” he said."
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/not-all-early-stage-ai-startups-are-created-equal/,TechCrunch,Not all early-stage AI startups are created equal,"The AI sector has gotten hotter over the last year. But unlike many of past venture fads — like crypto or web3 — the AI sector had a number of large startups and legacy players already active when the market started to froth. There have been AI exits and there are even whiffs of potential government regulation. This dynamic makes it a much more complex ecosystem for founders and investors alike — especially considering many of them weren’t paying attention to AI even a year ago. Entrepreneurs have flocked to the sector, and early-stage investors are trying to cut through the noise to find which startups are merely riding the hype and which have the potential to grow into substantial companies. One thing, not unlike other sectors, is that investors are looking for companies with a moat, or competitive advantage over rivals. With deep-pocketed players like Microsoft, Google and OpenAI also actively building in the category, investors want to make sure they aren’t backing companies that could be made irrelevant by the actions of one of the larger entities. Chris Wake, the founder and managing partner at Atypical Ventures, told TechCrunch+ that while his firm is currently taking a step back from AI to see how things play out, he doesn’t see much appeal of startups that are building on top of existing large language models. “Building on someone else’s model to solve a business problem, you [have to] understand it’s a race to the bottom,” Wake said. “You can create an interesting business but not necessarily a transformative business. For me, that doesn’t seem incredibly interesting.” "
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/tinder-to-launch-a-high-end-membership-this-fall-amid-product-refresh/,TechCrunch,Tinder to launch a ‘high-end’ membership this fall amid product refresh,"Tinder is preparing to launch a new “high-end” membership later this fall as well as a product refresh aimed at better catering to Gen Z users, according to parent company Match Group, as part of its Q2 2023 earnings release on Tuesday. The new Tinder membership was confirmed earlier this year by Tinder CPO Mark Van Ryswyk, who had then dubbed the $500-per-month offering “Tinder Vault” in an interview with Fast Company. As inspiration for the new product, Van Ryswyk cited learnings from Match Group’s July 2022 acquisition of another high-end dating app, The League, which could cost users up to $1,000 per week. The exec said that indicated there’s a market for daters who are willing to pay for quality matches and experiences that lead them into new relationships. But he indicated the product would rely on technology, not human matchmakers. The company shared today it expects the initial pricing for the new membership to be “substantially higher” than Tinder’s current offerings, given the extra benefits it entails. In addition, the product will have limited availability making it a more exclusive offering. Further details weren’t available in the company’s shareholder letter but may come up during the Q&A in tomorrow’s call with investors. The company also noted Tinder would roll out an “important” product refresh in the second half of the year with a focus on better catering to its core Gen Z audience. This refresh will include features like prompts, quizzes and conversation starters, as well as leverage AI to surface the right content to the right people. “While the core Swipe feature will remain central to the Tinder experience, the changes are meant to make the app more dynamic and engaging,” Tinder’s shareholder letter reads. “We expect these features to begin rolling out in select markets later this month.” In the quarter, Match Group generated revenue of $830 million, up 4% year-over-year, and forecast next quarter’s revenue of $875-885 million, citing Tinder’s return to growth. The company had been expected to report $811.4 million in revenue, according to FactSet. Tinder was responsible for $475 million in direct revenue in Q2, up 6% year-over-year, which the company attributed to its strategic decision to focus the first half of the year on optimizations and a new marketing campaign, “It Starts with a Swipe,” that translated into “revenue acceleration and improved user growth,” it said. Image Credits: Match The campaign helped in terms of new user signups and in encouraging lapsed users, including women, to rejoin. The company also referenced new U.S. pricing optimizations introduced at the end of Q1 and uplift from popular weekly subscription packages as aiding in Tinder’s growth. Image Credits: Match The downside of the pricing optimizations at Tinder was a decline in payers, which dropped 4% year-over-year to 10.5 million, as conversions decreased. Match Group payers overall declined 5% year-over-year to 15.6 million. Among other earnings highlights, Hinge was cited as one of the top three dating apps by downloads in 14 markets globally. The app also pulled in $90 million in revenue in the quarter, up 35% year-over-year, with 1.2 million payers. The company also reported operating income of $215 million, representing an operating margin of 26%. Adjusted operating income was $301 million, representing a margin of 36%. Match Group’s earnings call will be hosted on Wednesday, 8:30 AM ET."
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/tuesday-capital-a-silicon-valley-firm-that-moved-to-austin-during-the-pandemic-captures-31m-for-its-newest-seed-stage-fund/,TechCrunch,"Tuesday Capital, a Silicon Valley firm that moved to Austin during the pandemic, captures $31M for its newest seed-stage fund","Austin seems to agree with Tuesday Capital. When the 12-year-old seed-stage outfit — originally called CrunchFund  —  was co-founded by longtime VC Patrick Gallagher and TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, it was interwoven with the Silicon Valley scene. In has since widened its net. Part of the shift owes to the pandemic, when many venture firms began meeting with far-flung founders online. Part of it owes to James Prashant Fonseka. He joined Tuesday Capital as an associate in 2015, was promoted to partner in 2020, and lived like a “nomad” for much of that strange time, connecting in person with founders Tuesday Capital might have missed otherwise. Indeed, Tuesday’s team ultimately decided to move the firm from San Francisco to Austin, and it has “definitely been easier to get to New York and other East Coast cities,” says Gallagher, who says he feels “great about the decision” to pull up the firm’s Bay Area stakes. “We have a strong community of founders from our portfolio companies that are now based in Austin,” he says, referring to some who moved during the pandemic and three other teams that Tuesday Capital has backed since it relocated. Austin also “expanded our reach and increased our access to really great deal flow,” Gallagher insists. The transition went smoothly enough that Gallagher says the outfit just closed its fifth seed-stage fund with $31 million in capital commitments from many of the same family offices and institutions that have supported Tuesday Capital for years. It wasn’t a piece of cake, suggests Gallagher. The firm is too small for large institutional investors. SPACs have fallen out of fashion, cutting off one avenue for some of Tuesday Capital’s portfolio companies to go public. (Those of its portfolio companies that merged with blank-check companies and got themselves onto the market include Rover, Opendoor, Satellogic, Inspirato, and Getaround.) Meanwhile, the economic climate has obviously changed meaningfully between now and when Tuesday Capital announced a similar size fund ($30 million), almost exactly two years ago. “I definitely think that it is harder than ever to raise a fund in general, regardless of size,” Gallagher says. Nevertheless, the firm’s portfolio, along with the support it offers startups — which includes PR, design, and community building — were leading reasons why LPs have continued to back the firm across its various funds, Gallagher says. Though Tuesday Capital doesn’t yet have the kind of cash on cash returns about which some firms might brag (“it takes a long time for our funds to start to generate meaningful liquidity,” he explains), it has shown its ability to get into buzzy deals, certainly. In addition to writing checks to Uber, Digital Ocean, Gitlab, Opendoor, and Airbnb, among others, its still-private portfolio also holds some highly valued companies, including Zipline (valued at $4.2 billion back in April), Solugen ($2 billion as of last October), and Human Interest ($1 billion as of a year ago). LPs also see what a lot of VCs have seen across 2023, suggests Gallagher, including the opportunity for VCs to get more bang for their buck at long last. Though the firm plans to continue writing initial checks of $250,000 to $500,000, it’s “definitely getting more ownership today compared to 18 months ago,” though Gallagher adds that it’s “still less” than when the firm started in 2011. Tuesday Capital is far from alone is choosing to move its headquarters from the Bay Area to Austin. Other venture firms to do so in recent years include Founders Fund, Mithril Capital, 8VC, and Breyer Capital, among others. Bill Gurley, a Texas native who was long the highest-profile investor at the boutique venture firm Benchmark, also recently made the move to Austin, reportedly fulfilling a promise when he married his wife that they’d move back to Texas once they were empty nesters."
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/privateer-wants-to-create-a-data-ride-sharing-economy-for-space/,TechCrunch,Privateer wants to create a ‘data ride-sharing economy’ for space,"Privateer Space is launching a new module for satellite operators called Pono, which the company says will help make space data available at scale and at a far lower cost than it is today. The first Pono prototype will launch on a D-Orbit space tug in late 2023. Based on the data it receives from this first prototype in orbit, the company will launch a second, iteratively designed Pono module in mid-2024 before making it fully available to customers early the following year. When Privateer emerged from stealth in 2021, led by Alex Fielding and Steve Wozniak, the company characterized its main mission as space situational awareness: creating the “Google Maps of space,” for satellite mission planning and even orbital debris tracking. The company’s first product, Wayfinder, offers such tracking for spacecraft and other objects in space. But combined with Pono, Privateer is now looking to build a marketplace for data, where customers can “ride-share” on satellites and task them to collect data on whatever region of Earth is of interest. In a statement, Wozniak said that this is akin to when GPS technology became widely available. “Building a data ride-sharing economy in and from space, paired with our on-orbit AI, enables Privateer to give away the safety, sustainability and optimization technology that helps earn satellite operators more customers while giving a global user base a way to access space that traditionally has been reserved for large governments only,” he said. “This is similar to when GPS technology became available to the masses and we expect it to have a similar impact.”"
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review/,TechCrunch,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 review,"In February 2020, Samsung planted its flag in the sand. Screen issues aside, the original Galaxy Fold was met with a mixed response. “Innovation for innovation’s sake” was a common refrain. The wildly expensive device arrived at just a hair under $2,000. People questioned whether anyone really needed to carry a tablet in their pocket. The device was big and bulky. And then there was the crease. I won’t go so far as saying the company was definitively proven correct, but in 2023, things are certainly trending that way. According to Counterpoint, foldable shipments grew 64% y-o-y in Q1, hitting 2.5 million. It’s a drop in the bucket versus the overall market, but it’s a positive trend for a category many assumed was dead on arrival. It’s doubly impressive given that — until recently — there simply weren’t many foldables on the market. Here’s the thing about successfully planting your flag in the sand: The next thing you know, you’re surrounded by everyone else’s flag. Again, I’m not quite ready to declare 2023 the year of the foldable, but it’s certainly the year a lot more companies got into the act. Motorola released a second, Google’s got one, OnePlus is readying its own and its parent company already has a pair, echoing the Samsung’s two form factors. Image Credits: Brian Heater Heck, even Apple is rumored to be getting into the game in 2024/2025, pending apparent supply chain concerns. The more the category grows, the more competition the Galaxy Z line will face. China is now the world’s largest foldables market by a sizable distance, courtesy of its own 117% y-o-y growth. Samsung is currently a close third in the country, just behind Huawei and Oppo — of course the former has been struggling on the international stage, courtesy of the trade war. Samsung released the W23 and W23 Flip — variants of the Fold 4 and Flip 4 with a more blinged-out black and gold design — in the country last year and has seen growth as a result. You only get one chance to make a first impression, as they say. The original Fold undoubtedly made a big one, but even boundary-pushing design is subject to the basic laws of physics. You can’t expect the wheel to be reinvented every year. Some upgrades will be more impactful than others, but on the whole, it’s a game of refinements after you hammer out those initial kinks. The Fold 5 is one of those iterative devices. It’s a perfectly fine thing for a smartphone to be, but it’s unavoidably made more pronounced amid the rapidly changing category the line helped create. The product’s position in the market means it will invariably be the baseline against which all other foldables are contrast — fairly or unfairly, for better or worse. Image Credits: Brian Heater As personal preferences go, I’ve always found the Fold to be big and bulky. Portability is something I value in foldable design, and this ain’t it. The first Flip spelled out the category’s true potential for me, while this year’s Google Fold delivered something much closer to my platonic industrial design ideal. Each design has its trade-offs, of course — hardware design is a great meditation on compromise. It’s a lesson on prioritizing certain characteristics over others and a tacit understanding that producing things at scale is going to make some people happier than others, while leaving every single one of them at least slightly disappointed. For the Fold, priority comes in the form of a big screen. It’s the logical extension of the extended project that began with the Galaxy Note in 2011. Much like the Fold, the device had more than its share of detractors. The absurdity of a 5.3-inch screen! This manner of decadence is why Rome fell! Of course, more than a decade ago, that size screen required a much larger phone over all. The device-to-screen ratio improved a great deal over the years, and ultimately the entire Galaxy S line became phablets, making the Note ultimately redundant. Currently, the largest Galaxy S device is the 6.8-inch Ultra. It’s hard to imagine things expanding too far beyond that in the slate form factor (but listen, I’m a big enough man to admit I’ve been wrong about screen sizes before — me and Steve Jobs have that in common). At a certain point, it’s just too big to carry around. Image Credits: Brian Heater Of course, for many, phones crossed that threshold long ago. The Fold’s appeal, however, is the ability to carry around a 7.6-inch display in your pocket — well into the realm of what we would call a tablet. The displays are effectively unchanged here. The 7.6-inch main screen sports a 2176 x 1812 resolution, while the external is 2316 x 906. Both have an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz. In spite of what some angry people on the internet will likely say in the social media replies to this very story, the appeal is clear. Given the choice between watching a film on a six-inch smartphone and a 7.6-inch, I know what I’m picking every time. Granted, I also have a larger tablet at home, so I don’t find myself in that specific scenario every day. As for the trade-offs, well, there are a couple. For one thing, the device is narrow. Again, increasing the width of the device would only make it that much larger and heavier. The external screen has, mercifully, expanded over the generations and become that much more useful in the process. It’s not quite edge-to-edge, but it’s getting there. But while 6.2 inches sounds like more than enough screen, the proportions are out of whack — even more so than the Fold’s main display. At 23.1:9, it’s extremely long and very narrow. There are certain things you can do just fine with that aspect ratio — reading your Bluesky feed for instance. Typing on said Bluesky feed, however, is a different story. I brought the Fold and Flip to a couple of concerts last week for camera-testing purposes. Unfolding a 7.6-inch screen to post on social media is awkward — as is typing on something that big. I gave the external display a shot, and I have to say, every time I review one of these devices, it feels like I’m learning how to type again and suddenly I assume everyone around me is silently judging (truthfully, it’s New York and almost certainly no one cares). Image Credits: Brian Heater The other issue with the form factor — as alluded to above — is the sheer size of the device that surrounds it. Again, we’ve got plenty of echoes from the Note’s earliest days. The Fold isn’t my favorite approach to the form factor by any stretch — just one man’s opinion, of course. If foldables were for everyone, we would be in the midst of a very different smartphone market. More importantly, the company has found success with the design. Now that it has an alternative in the form of the Flip, it’s hard to imagine Samsung straying very far from the established dimensions. Thankfully, one of the key improvements from the Fold 4 to Fold 5 is a thinner design (again, Note echoes). This was accomplished with what the company calls a Flex Hinge. At 13.4 mm folded and 6.1 unfolded, it’s a noticeable decrease from the Fold 4’s 15.8/6.3mm. The folded profile is a more significant reduction, because 1) It’s two reduced unfolded profiles stacked atop one another and 2) The gap between them has been observably reduced. The move follows the Pixel Fold launch, which touted its own innovative hinge design as a major selling point, including a barely perceptible gap. At 12.1 mm folded and 5.8 millimeters unfolded, Google still comes out on top. However, it’s worth pointing out that the gap reduction may have contributed to some of the Fold’s reported screen damage. Quoting myself here: Image Credits: Brian Heater Something to keep an eye on as more of these are released into the world. When I put the question to Samsung, however, the company noted the inclusion of a bumper around the edge of the device that prohibits the two sides from coming in direct contact with one another. Along with the thinner design comes a reduction in weight, from 9.28 ounces to 8.92. It’s more than a full ounce lighter than the Pixel Fold, in spite of having the same internal screen size. Beyond the thinner footprint, the biggest update from a hardware perspective is the new(ish) chip. Both the Fold 5 and Flip 5 have been upgraded to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Platform for Galaxy, which debuted back in February with the Galaxy S23. Rumors that the foldables would be among the first to sport a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 2 didn’t pan out — and frankly, it’s not entirely clear whether that chip is going to arrive at all. Image Credits: Brian Heater The Samsung collab brings some slight processing boosts versus the standard 8 Gen 2, but you you’re not likely to see a large difference. What it does deliver however, is arguably just as — or perhaps more — important to users’ day to day. Specifically, it improves battery and camera performance. That’s doubly important, since the hardware for both is, again, functionally the same as the Fold 4. [gallery ids=""2575490,2575499,2575497,2575496,2575495,2575494""] The importance of computational photography only continues to grow in the smartphone world. While the Fold 5 maintains its predecessor’s excellent triple camera system (50-megapixel main, 12-megapixel ultra-wide and 10-megapixel tele with 3x optical zoom), the Snapdragon’s image signal processing continues to improve. The Fold 5’s rear cameras can take some truly excellent photos. Shots captured in full daylight were extremely sharp and vibrant. I would be more than satisfied using the Fold 5 as a primary camera. [gallery ids=""2577339,2577334,2577344,2577335,2577342,2577336,2577343,2577338,2577340,2577341""] The system struggled a bit when I took it to last week’s Le Tigre and Nuggets anniversary shows, but that’s a lot to throw at a smartphone camera. We’re talking dynamic motions, ever changing and contrasting lights and a good bit of zoom, since I have the tendency to show up around 10 minutes before the bands start. That said, the inclusion of a telephoto (absent on the Flip) makes a big difference; 3x optical isn’t huge, but it goes a long way toward reducing noise and image degradation. I also have to give a shout-out to portrait mode. The feature still isn’t perfect with uneven edges, but it’s improved a lot over the years. I was hanging on a bench in Astoria Park on Sunday, reading some Cormac McCarthy on the Fold’s Kindle app, when a…let’s say “friendly” squirrel approached (did I mention I was eating a sandwich?). I snapped some shots in Portrait and was really impressed with the results. When I posted a few on social media, a colleague asked whether they had been shot on a phone or SLR. It’s clearer when you take a closer look, but it’s still impressive that the question had to be asked. [gallery ids=""2577325,2577323,2577329,2577328,2577327,2577326,2577324""] The battery is 4,400mAh (again, like last year). That’s significantly larger than the Fold’s 3,700mAh, but can’t touch the Galaxy S23 Ultra’s 5,000mAh. Once again, we run into a spatial problem here. Specifically, the nature of a foldable requires the battery to be split in two, on either side of the fold. Likely in the not too distant future, we’ll be discussing flexible batteries (Samsung has certainly been filing patents), but we’re not there yet. All that said, The Fold 5 packs more than enough battery life to get you through a full day of use without concern. It ekes out more than both the Fold 4 and Flip 5. Samsung continues to refine the Fold’s software experience. In fact, the line is blurring a bit between the desktop and mobile here. Again, the device is functionally a tablet when unfolded. The centerpiece of the experience is a desktop-style taskbar that keeps your four most recent apps front and center, for more seamless switching. You can also drag and drop five frequently used apps to stay there all the time. It’s a handy feature. I like it. Multiwindow functionality works fairly well as a split screen. You can have up to three apps open at once, but more than two can feel like overkill and real estate is still a valuable commodity on a screen this size. There are other tweaks as well, including the ability to drag and drop images between apps. It’s been fascinating watching companies backward-engineer desktop functionality for mobile devices, and multitasking has definitely come a long way. The Fold is, once again, compatible with the S Pen. There’s no built-in docking slot (a problem of architecture one imagines), though the company does have some nice-looking cases that do the trick. The Fold format is great for things like teleconferencing in that it effectively serves as its own stand, though the under-display four-megapixel camera leaves a lot to be desired. I fully understand why some many companies are looking for alternatives to the hole-punch camera, but the technology isn’t where it should be on a premium device like this. The display interference makes for shots that look dim and smudged — not the quality you want for what’s ostensibly a business machine. Shot with the Samsung Galaxy Flip 5. Image Credits: Brian Heater I do, however, appreciate what Samsung calls the “Flex Mode Panel.” It’s the allocation of the bottom screen when the phone is folded at a 90-degree angle and placed in landscape mode. It’s effectively a control panel for features like camera, video/music playback and teleconferencing. I should mention, one application I’ve really grown to appreciate on the form factor is Kindle. I have a devoted e-reader that I mostly use for travel, but the ability to pull a phone out of your pocket to read a book on a 7.6-inch screen is underappreciated. It’s great for commutes, and the Amazon syncs progress across devices, so you can pick up where you left off. Holding the device open at a slight angle reminiscent of a real book is a nice experience. That said, I’d avoid reading in direct sunlight. That’s where e-readers really shine, so to speak. Sunlight is also a great way to highlight the ever-present crease. Now we can’t get out of here without talking price. It’s come down a little since the first Fold launched just shy of $2,000. But $1,800 is still prohibitively expensive for a vast majority of consumers — particularly in an era of economic downturns, in which pricing is a major contributor to declining smartphone sales. Last year, a tear down by Nikkei put the Galaxy Z Fold 4’s component price at an estimated $670. That’s less than 40% of its retail price. Presumably there hasn’t been a huge change for the Fold 5, potentially leaving Samsung with some wiggle room for what it charges (the iPhone, by comparison, is around 46%). Presumably the more of these they sell, the lower the per unit price will become, and if Samsung faces real competition on the international scale, that could potentially impact price. Image Credits: Brian Heater When I first asked the company about the sales being down between the Fold and Flip, it was implied that the two devices are in an effective dead heat. Upon further questioning, they revealed that the Flip has the advantage — though the company isn’t in the habit of breaking down sales figures. I have to assume, however, that the Flip’s (relatively) reasonable $1,000 price tag is a major contributor. As a subcategory, foldables have bucked the trend of declining smartphone sales. That’s due in no small part to it being a new form factor, that’s started from a much lower point year-over-year. But it’s an encouraging trend for Samsung and the industry. Given the small list of updates found here, I can’t imagine the Fold 5 winning many converts that the Fold 4 couldn’t. Nor does Samsung offer a super compelling case to upgrade over recent generation Folds. It’s a slow and steady process, but Samsung’s been at it for a while. Theirs continues to be the most fully realized foldable on the market from a hardware and software perspective. I continue to lean toward the Flip for reasons of personal preferences (ditto the Pixel Fold), but if the Fold is your cup of tea, it continues to be the one to beat."

In a note posted on the company’s blog, CEO Will Marshall said the decision to cut staff came about after “a deep assessment of our business and spending.” “Our business has scaled rapidly and continues to grow apace, but the expansion of projects has also increased cost and complexity, which slowed us down in some regards,” he said. “We are making changes to prioritize our attention on the highest ROI opportunities for our business and mission, while reinforcing our path to profitability, consistent with what we shared on our prior earnings call.” Planet went public in December 2021 after combining with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPACs. Their public listing was part of a huge boom of SPAC IPOs, though most of the space companies that went public in this way have badly failed to hit their projections on revenue and other targets. But Planet has been one of the notable standouts amongst this crowd, consistently reporting growing revenues that end up toward the top end of their projections. But operating costs have also been high, and the company has yet to achieve profitability. “I want to be clear that I am responsible for the decisions that led us here,” Marshall said. “I know this has significant effects on the lives of our team and their families, and for that I am sorry. We do not make these changes lightly.” Planet’s stock closed at $11.35 a share the day after it went public; yesterday, it closed at $3.75 a share."
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/youtube-star-mrbeast-sues-ghost-kitchen-behind-mrbeast-burger/,TechCrunch,YouTube star MrBeast sues ghost kitchen behind MrBeast Burger,"YouTube mega-success MrBeast is suing Virtual Dining Concepts, the company behind his ghost kitchen food chain, MrBeast Burger, for damaging the MrBeast brand. According to the lawsuit, thousands of fans have sent in negative reviews of MrBeast Burger, many of whom shared photos of burgers and chicken sandwiches with uncooked, inedible meat. MrBeast’s team also claims that Virtual Dining Concepts violated their contract by failing to pay royalties and registering MrBeast Burger trademarks without the YouTuber’s permission. So, MrBeast’s team is suing the ghost kitchen company to get out of the contract and shut down the MrBeast Burger business. The MrBeast Burger franchise has made millions of dollars since opening in 2020, though, according to the lawsuit, MrBeast himself — the 25-year-old Jimmy Donaldson — has “not received a dime” and is owed money from the venture. To make matters worse, customers say the food is “inedible.”  Since launch, the burger chain has gotten mixed reviews. Still, the brand is popular enough that last year, 10,000 kids and teens crowded New Jersey’s American Dream mall for the opening of a brick-and-mortar MrBeast Burger store. Some queued all night to be at the front of the line. But per the lawsuit, MrBeast feels he is letting these fans down. “When Joe DiMaggio was asked why he hustled on every play of every game, he responded that ‘there is always a kid who may be seeing me for the first time. I owe him my best,'” begins the legal complaint. “This encapsulates the philosophy that one of the most accomplished and prolific online content creators in the world [MrBeast] brings to everything he does.” (Note: lawsuits typically do not open with Joe DiMaggio quotes.) According to MrBeast’s team, the YouTuber complained to Virtual Dining Concepts about the ghost kitchen’s lack of quality control, but the company did not rectify these issues. The lawsuit includes an 85-page document highlighting just a fraction of the bad press around the enterprise, which call MrBeast burger the “worst burger ever,” “a terrible meme burger,” “raw and disgusting” and “tough as shoe leather.” Virtual Dining Concepts responded to MrBeast’s complaint by saying it’s “riddled with false statements and inaccuracies,” and that “any negative customer reviews reflect the experience and opinion of a very small minority” of customers. The company also refuted MrBeast’s claim that the quality of food from MrBeast Burger has tarnished his reputation. “Mr. Donaldson’s notoriety has grown exponentially over the life of the MrBeast Burger brand, in part because of the MrBeast Burger brand itself,” reads Virtual Dining Concepts’ statement. MrBeast has 172 million YouTube subscribers, one of the top channels on the entire platform. At the time he launched his restaurant chain, he had around 50 million subscribers. Though his following has increased more than three times over since, this is more likely due to his continued success at churning out wildly viral content, like his “real life Squid Game” video, which has 471 million views. Per Virtual Dining Concepts’ statement, MrBeast Burger has 10 million customers. As a ghost kitchen, Virtual Dining Concepts uses the kitchens of local restaurants to prepare the food, then sells it on delivery apps like Grubhub, Uber Eats and DoorDash. The company works with other internet stars like the hosts of sports podcast Pardon My Take, who opened a restaurant called Pardon My Cheesesteak.  But consumers are losing trust in ghost kitchens. In March, Uber Eats removed 5,000 such brands from its app. John Mullenholz of Uber Eats told The Wall Street Journal that customers are “effectively seeing 12 versions of the same menu” on the app, which sparks a “Wild West, anything goes kind of situation” that “erodes consumer confidence.” In the best cases, ghost kitchens can offer aspiring restauranteurs a chance to pilot a menu without paying the costs of a physical space; but oftentimes, ghost kitchens are actually just mediocre moneygrabs run out of chains like Chili’s, Applebee’s or even Chuck E. Cheese. In the lawsuit, MrBeast’s team included an email from a parent who ordered MrBeast Burger for his kids, and after being disappointed by the food quality, he managed to trace the ghost kitchen back to a 7-11. “I just don’t see how a place like 7-11 should be preparing and serving $10 burgers and expensive fries for a figure so well known and loved by so many people especially when they arrive in a white plastic bag,” the customer wrote. Other ghost kitchens operated by Virtual Dining Concepts seem to have similar problems, according to online customer reviews. One Pardon My Cheesesteak customer in Kansas wrote on Yelp, “This isn’t a real place. I ordered from doordash and got a call an hr later saying ihop doesn’t have the ingredients to fulfill my order lol they are just a vendor for various restaurants.” Internet creators like MrBeast turn to businesses like food and merchandise to capitalize on their possibly fleeting fame by developing alternative revenue streams. But if you order a raw burger that’s branded with your favorite YouTuber’s name, you’ll be left with a sour (if not worse) taste in your mouth. Update, 8/2/23, 5:15 PM ET, with statement from Virtual Dining Concepts."

The malfunctioning has frequently been accompanied by driver-facing messages indicating that power steering assist is reduced or disabled, according to the report. The preliminary evaluation into 2023 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles comes after regulators received 12 complaints from owners, according to NHTSA’s investigation. NHTSA has put Tesla under the microscope many times over the years, largely in response to the automaker’s advanced driver assistance systems, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD). It’s not clear if this investigation relates directly to either ADAS, and NHTSA did not respond in time to TechCrunch’s request for more information. A driver in Woodbridge, Virginia complained that their Tesla Performance Model 3 began showing problems two weeks after delivery on June 15. “Today while driving and making a left turn, the steering wheel locked up while showing an error code UI_a020 stating steering assist is disabled,” the driver wrote in a complaint. “Vehicle steering gets locked, and once you get out and get back in, the car code disappears; however after driving a mile or 2 code reappears, and the steering gets very stiff, making it almost impossible to turn in either direction. Very unsafe and unreliable to drive on highways at high speeds. Please investigate this matter, as I am not the only one with this issue.” Another Model 3 driver reported in May the “car steering felt stuck and slid off the road which resulted in crashing into a tree.” A complaint from a Model Y owner in April said the “wheel jerked hard right and made a thud” and that Tesla had moved their service visit from May 2 to May 25 due to a backlog of parts. The preliminary evaluation is the first step to a formal investigation to determine if the problem poses an unreasonable safety risk. If NHTSA were to demand a recall, it would need to upgrade the probe to an engineering analysis."

Curve is one of the largest decentralized exchanges (DEX) in the crypto market today, with about $1.67 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to data on DeFi TVL aggregator DeFiLlama. A handful of DeFi projects’ pools were also hacked, including PEGD’s pETH/ETH: $11 million; Metronome’s msETH/ETH: $3.4 million; Alchemix’s alETH/ETH: $22.6 million; and Curve DAO: around $24.7 million, according to LlamaRisk’s post-exploit assessment. A bug found in older versions of the Vyper compiler contract programming language caused a failure in a security feature used by a handful of Curve liquidity pools. An admin in Curve Finance’s Telegram group declined to comment further to TechCrunch+ and referred us back to the post-exploit assessment. By crypto standards, this wasn’t considered a “big” hack; Curve is a massive DEX, and this hack makes up about 4% of its TVL. A portion of the exploit was done by white hat hacker user c0ffeebabe.eth, who returned 2,879 ether, roughly $5.4 million, to Curve, according to on chain data. But this exploit isn’t the only problem Curve — and the broader crypto space — is facing. "

The idea behind Allo is to help users create a mindful money practice that allows them to approach their earnings, spending, saving, investing and giving with a sense of fulfillment. Founded in 2021, Allo helps users focus on gratitude and the importance of being aware of not only your numbers, but also your values and priorities when it comes to personal finance. Allo was founded by Will Choi and Paul Montoy-Wilson, who both previously founded Aviate, an intelligent homescreen startup that was acquired by TechCrunch parent company Yahoo in 2014. With over 15 years of experience in software, the duo wanted to build a company that helps people create positive habits with their finances. Unlike budgeting apps that only focus on spending categories like bills, insurance and transportation, Allo includes categories like nature, family, giving, working out and healthy eating. Users can choose to have a daily, weekly or monthly check-in with the app in order to become aware of their finances. Image Credits: Allo “There are plenty of apps out there that will help optimize your net worth or help you save an extra dollar per month and tell you you overspent on a coffee,” Montoy-Wilson told TechCrunch in an interview. “If there’s a budgeting app out there that works for you, that’s great. We’re not trying to take users from budgeting apps that they love. But, the reality is that those budgeting apps don’t work for most people.” Montoy-Wilson says budgeting apps can make people feel guilty, which can lead them to avoiding their finances altogether. He believes simply being aware of your finances is an important practice, which is why Allo makes it easier to do so in bite-sized chunks. To get started with the app, users complete Allo’s introductory course and learn from experts on how to feel more peaceful, confident and grateful when it comes to money. The app will ask you to select a few values that you want to focus on, such as health, being generous, exercise and kids. You can then use the values to tag different transactions during your daily, weekly or monthly check-ins. Once you have set up a check-in, the app focuses on two things when encouraging you to be aware of your transactions. First, the app will encourage you to look at the things you appreciate. You can reflect on the transactions that made you happy, such as the money you spent on your family or well-being. Next, the app will encourage you to reflect on the transactions that you don’t feel great about and may want to follow up on. For instance, you may see a transaction for a subscription that you intended on canceling beforehand and make a note to do so. Or, you may come across a transaction where you spent a lot of money going out, and don’t see it as a good use of your earnings. By reflecting on this transaction, you could make a note about wanting to instead spend more money on something you actually care about, like your health.

Say you want to focus on health, you can either decide to just pay more attention to your health-related transactions or actually spend more money in that area by doing things like eating healthier or working out more. “A core principle of Allo is being aware of your numbers, but also being aware of your emotions,” Montoy-Wilson said. “What we’re trying to do with Allo is make it easier through bite-sized chunks to engage with your finances and start changing your relationship with money. And then making it easier to keep that practice going over and over again.” Once you have completed your check-in, the app won’t surface anything else until your next one. Allo sees this as an “inbox zero” mentality that will help users set down their phone and not have to focus on their finances until their next check-in. Over the past year, around 500 people across the United States have been testing Allo. The app is now available to download on the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store. The app offers a free 14-day trial and costs $6.99 per month. The company currently does not have any plans to expand beyond the United States. Allo is self-funded and Montoy-Wilson says the goal to keep it independent. The company currently does not have any plans to raise funding."

2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/meta-release-ai-powered-chatbots-with-different-personas/,TechCrunch,Meta is reportedly preparing to release AI-powered chatbots with different personas,"Meta is gearing up to roll out AI-powered chatbots with different personas as early as next month, according to a new report from the Financial Times. The chatbots are designed to have humanlike conversations with users on Meta’s social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. The report indicates that these chatbots will take on different personas, including one that advises users on travel plans in the style of a surfer and another that speaks like Abraham Lincoln. The new chatbots could launch as early as next month. Meta reportedly sees the move as a way to boost engagement with its social platforms. Users will be able to use the chatbots as a way to search the platform and receive recommendations. Of course, the chatbots are also expected to be a fun offering for users to play around with. Meta declined to comment. The Financial Times notes that in addition to boosting engagement, the chatbots also have the potential to collect new amounts of data on users, which could help Meta better target users with relevant content and ads. Given this possibility, the chatbots are likely to raise privacy concerns. Meta isn’t the only popular company interested in giving its users access to an AI-powered chatbot. In February, Snapchat launched an AI chatbot called “My AI” that’s powered by OpenAI’s GPT technology. Users are able to have a conversation with the AI, and Snapchat also recently rolled out the ability for paid users to send Snaps of what they’re up to in order to receive a generative Snap back from the chatbot. In addition, the company recently began “early testing” of sponsored links within the feature. Not all users were happy with the addition of the new chatbot, as Snapchat saw a spike in one-star reviews after the feature launched. The launch of the feature also raised concerns about how the chatbot chatted with young users about adult subjects like booze and sex. Meta’s chatbots will likely raise similar concerns. During the company’s second-quarter earnings call last week, Mark Zuckerberg said Meta was building a number of new AI-powered products and that it would share more details later this year. Zuckerberg noted that “AI could act as assistants, coaches, or that can help you interact with businesses and creators and more.” He went on to note that “these new products will improve everything that we do across both mobile apps and the metaverse.” More details on Meta’s AI road map are expected to be announced at its Connect developer event in September. Meta reported 11% year-over-year revenue growth, a year after the company posted its first-ever quarterly revenue decline."
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/in-challenge-to-tiktok-youtube-shorts-gains-new-creation-tools-like-collab-and-qas/,TechCrunch,"In challenge to TikTok, YouTube Shorts gains new creation tools like Collab and Q&As","As competition with TikTok and Instagram Reels heats up, YouTube today announced an expanded suite of creation tools for its own short-form video platform, YouTube Shorts. Among the new features are tools for remixing, adding effects, stickers, going live and others aimed at encouraging inspiration. The company is also starting a test of a new mobile-first vertical live experience that will help live creators get discovered in the main Shorts feed. Explains YouTube, Shorts are now being watched by over 2 billion logged-in users each month, prompting the release of more tools to improve the Shorts experience for creators. One of the key new tools arriving starting today is “Collab,” a way for a creator to record a Short in a side-by-side format with other YouTube or Shorts videos. The feature joins other remixing tools like Green Screen, which uses a YouTube video or a Short as the background of a Short, and Cut, which lets a creator snip out a one- to five-second clip from a YouTube video or Short to remix into their own. Collab, meanwhile, offers a variety of side-by-side layout options for a split-screen format and is available from the same “Remix” option on videos. Collab is coming first to iOS with Android to follow. Image Credits: YouTube YouTube is also adding a new Q&A sticker that lets creators ask their audience questions and get responses in the comments. Plus, creators can now reply to comments with a Short video to continue the conversation — a feature similar to one on TikTok. Image Credits: YouTube For live creators, YouTube will begin testing the insertion of live videos in a new version of the Shorts feed, again similar to TikTok. Viewers in the test group will see previews of the live videos mixed in with other Shorts as they scroll. If they tap to watch a live video, they’ll then be placed into a feed of just live videos, as on TikTok. YouTube notes that with its new, lower eligibility requirements to join the YouTube Partner Program, the live feed could unlock more possibilities around monetization for live video creators. Image Credits: YouTube The company is also rolling out new tools aimed at encouraging inspiration. One new feature will bundle both the audio and the effect from a video you’re remixing automatically, so it’s easier to jump into a trend. To do so, you’ll tap the Remix button and choose “use sound.” YouTube will then surface both the effect and the same audio time stamp from the Short you had just watched. Another recently introduced option is the ability to save Shorts to playlists on YouTube, which could serve as a way to curate videos with effects you’ve been inspired to use in later Shorts, for example. While most of the new features are rolling out today, YouTube says it will soon start to test new “recomposition” tools that will help creators turn horizontal videos into Shorts. These will work by allowing creators who choose to remix a video to adjust the layout, zoom and crop of the segment, in addition to using split-screen elements. The feature, which is due to begin testing in the next few weeks, would broaden the number of videos that could be remixed into Shorts. The changes follow a recent announcement from TikTok which would allow creators to make video ads to earn more money on the platform, as well as another from Instagram that added a new feature that made it easier to create Reels from templates. Shorts has seen healthy growth since its debut thanks to its deep integration into the YouTube platform. Last year, the company said 1.5 billion monthly logged-in YouTube users watched Shorts and that number grew by another half a billion as of this month’s earnings announcement, and the company touted that “watch time and monetization are moving in the right direction,” as well, without citing exact metrics."
2023-08-01,https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/kickstarter-requires-generative-ai-projects-to-disclose-additional-info/,TechCrunch,Kickstarter requires generative AI projects to disclose additional info,"As generative AI enters the mainstream, crowdfunding platform Kickstarter has struggled to formulate a policy that satisfies parties on all sides of the debate. Most of the generative AI tools used to create art and text today, including Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT, were trained on publicly available images and text from the web. But in many cases, the artists, photographers and writers whose content was scraped for training haven’t been given credit, compensation or a chance to opt out. The groups behind these AI tools argue that they’re protected by fair use doctrine — at least in the U.S. But content creators don’t necessarily agree, particularly where AI-generated content — or the AI tools themselves — are being monetized. In an effort to bring clarity, Kickstarter today announced that projects on its platform using AI tools to generate images, text or other outputs (e.g. music, speech or audio) will be required to disclose “relevant details” on their project pages going forward. These details must include information about how the project owner plans to use the AI content in their work as well as which components of their project will be wholly original and which elements will be created using AI tools. Image Credits: Kickstarter In addition, Kickstarter is mandating that new projects involving the development of AI tech, tools and software detail info about the sources of training data the project owner intends to use. The project owner will have to indicate how sources handle processes around consent and credit, Kickstarter says, and implement their own “safeguards” like opt-out or opt-in mechanisms for content creators. An increasing number of AI vendors offer opt-out mechanisms, but Kickstarter’s training data disclosure rule could prove to be contentious, despite efforts by the European Union and others to codify such practices into law. OpenAI, among others, has declined to reveal the exact source of its more recent systems’ training data for competitive — and possibly legal liability — reasons. Kickstarter’s new policy will go into effect on August 29. But the platform doesn’t plan to retroactively enforce it for projects submitted prior to that date, Susannah Page-Katz, Kickstarter’s director of trust and safety, said. “We want to make sure that any project that’s funded through Kickstarter includes human creative input and properly credits and obtains permission for any artist’s work that it references,” Page-Katz wrote in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. “The policy requires creators to be transparent and specific about how they use AI in their projects because when we’re all on the same page about what a project entails, it builds trust and sets the project up for success.” To enforce the new policy, project submissions on Kickstarter will have to answer a new set of questions, including several that touch on whether their project uses AI tech to generate artwork and the like or if the project’s primary focus is on developing generative AI tech. They’ll also be asked whether they have consent from the owners of the works used to produce — or train, as the case may be — AI-generated portions of their project. Image Credits: Kickstarter Once AI project creators submit their work, it’ll go through Kickstarter’s standard human moderation process. If it’s accepted, any AI components will be labeled as such in a newly added “Use of AI” section on the project page, Page-Katz says. “Throughout our conversations with creators and backers, what our community wanted most was transparency,” she added, noting that any use of AI that isn’t disclosed properly during the submission process may result in the project’s suspension. “We’re happy to directly answer this call from our community by adding a section to the project page where backers can learn about a project’s use of AI in the creator’s own words.” Kickstarter first indicated that it was considering a change in policy around generative AI in December, when it said that it would reevaluate whether media owned or created by others in an algorithm’s training data constituted copying or mimicking an artist’s work. Since then, the platform’s moved in fits and starts toward a new policy. Toward the end of last year, Kickstarter banned Unstable Diffusion, a group attempting to fund a generative AI art project that doesn’t include safety filters, letting users generate whatever artwork they please, including porn. Kickstarter justified the removal in part by implying that the project exploited particular communities and put people at risk of harm. More recently, Kickstarter approved, then removed, a project that used AI to plagiarize an original comic book — highlighting the challenges in moderating AI works."
